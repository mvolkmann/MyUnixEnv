This is a set of files I use to set up a new environment
on Unix, Linux or Mac OS X machines.

Clone this repository, cd to it, and enter
./setup

To download git submodules in MyUnixEnv/.vim/bundle
git submodule init
git submodule update

These lines were in the setup script, but I commented them out.
