Flexbox Notes

- a CSS layout standard
  * the spec changed significantly through three major revisions
  * to determine whether articles and tutorials are covering
    the "Candidate Recommendation", look for "display: flex",
    not "display: box" or "display: flexbox"
- browser support
  * Chrome 21+
  * Safari 6.1+
  * Firefox 22+
  * IE 11+
  * use a polyfill to support older browsers
    including IE 10, but not IE 9 or below
    - Flexibility: https://github.com/10up/flexibility
    - don't use Flexie, an outdated polyfill
- resources for learning
  * http://flexboxfroggy.com/
- key idea
  * nest containers in containers and use flexbox
    at multiple levels to specify any kind of layout
- Flexbox makes it SO much easier to center things horizontally and vertically,
  even groups of things!

- to make a container element use flexbox, set
  display: flex
  * when parent display is flex, block level children act like inline-block

- item alignment
  * justify-content is for horizontal
  * align-items is for vertical

- justify-content: aligns items horizontally within container
  * flex-start: aligns items to start
    which is the left side unless flex-direction is row-reverse
  * flex-end: aligns items to end
    which is the right side unless flex-direction is row-reverse
  * center: aligns at center
  * space-between: aligns items with equal spacing between each
    (no space before first or after last)
  * space-around: aligns items with equal spacing around each
    (half space before first and after last)

- align-items: aligns items vertically within container
  * flex-start: aligns items at top
  * flex-end: aligns items at bottom
  * center: aligns items at center
  * baseline: aligns items at baseline of container
  * stretch: stretches items to height of container
    - only works for items with no specified height

- align-self: does the same for a specific item
  * set to one of the align-items values

- flex-direction: sets order of items within container
  * row: left to right starting from left edge (default)
  * row-reverse: right to left starting from right edge
  * column: each item on its own row, top to bottom
  * column-reverse: each item on its own row, bottom to top

- order: changes order of elements
  * set to a positive or negative number
  * items with higher numbers appear after those with lower numbers
  * default value is 0

- flex-wrap: allows items to wrap onto new rows when they don't fit,
  and avoids having them be scaled horizontally
  * nowrap: all items on one row, scaling horizontally if necessary (default)
    - when items don't fit, they are scaled unless flex-wrap is not nowrap
  * wrap: items wrap to new rows if necessary
  * wrap-reverse: items wrap to new rows in reverse if necessary
  * set flex-direction to column to flip meaning of flex-wrap
    so items are in columns instead of rows

- flex-flow: combines flex-wrap and flex-direction into one property
  * ex. flex-flow: wrap column;

- row heights and column widths are stretched to fill container by default

- align-content: controls row heights and column widths
  * flex-start: rows/columns packed at start
  * flex-end: rows/columns packed at end
  * center: rows/columns packed in center
  * space-between: rows/columns have equal spacing between them
  * space-around: rows/columns have equal spacing around them
    (half space before first and after last)
  * stretch: rows/columns are stretched to fill container
    and each is the same height/width (default)
    - elements inside will stretch also
      unless they have a specified height/width
  * this has no effect when there is only one row/column

- flex-grow
  * causes elements to grow to fill available space
  * default is 0 which prevents growing
  * if all are 1, all grow the same amount
  * the percentage by which each element grows is
    its flex-grow value divided by the sum of
    the all the flex-grow values in the same parent
  * ex. for nav on left with fixed with and
    main on right with variable width,
    set main flex-grow to 1 and let nav flex-grow default to 0

- flex-shrink
  * allows elements to shrink if necessary to remain in available space
  * default is 0 which prevents shrinking

- flex-basis
  * specifies the starting size
    (width for row direction and height for column direction)
    before grow or shrink are applied

- the previous three properties, flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis,
  can be combined in one "flex" property
  * ex. flex: 2 3 100px;

- for responsive UIs, consider using media queries to apply
  different flexbox properties for different display widths
  * ex. using different "order" property values

Try your flexbox example code without using the "flexibility" polyfill.
