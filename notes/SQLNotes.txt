Create table
  create table {table-name} (
    {column-name} {type} {modifiers},
    ...
  )

Delete table
  drop table {table-name}

Add column
  alter table {table-name}
    add column {column-name} {type} {modifiers}

Delete column
  alter table {table-name}
    drop column {column-name}

Insert row
  insert into {table-name}
    ({column-name}, ...)
    values (value, ...)

Modify rows
  update {table-name}
  set {column-name}={value}, ...
  where {condition}
  ex. for SQL Server
    update some_table set end_date = cast('10/31/2014' as datetime) where id = 19

Upsert rows
- inserts if not present; updates if present
- in MySQL
  insert into {table-name}
    ({column-name}, ...)
    values (value, ...)
  on duplicate key update
    column-name-1 = v1,
    column-name-2 = v2,
    ...

Delete rows
  delete from {table-name}
  where {condition}

Select rows
  select [unique] {column-name}, ...
  from {table-name}, ...
  where {condition}
  order by {column-name}, ...
- the where and order by clauses are optional
- the where clause can use "like" for wildcard matching
  * % matches any number of characters including zero
  * _ matches any single character
  * ex. select age from people where lastname like 'V_lk%';
- to find records where a given column is or isn't null
  * {column-name} IS NULL   or   {column-name} IS NOT NULL
- when selecting from more than one table (a join),
  select columns are prefixed by a table alias and
  can have their own alias to avoid name conflicts
  * example
    select n.namespace as namespace
    from Element e, Namespace n
    where e.sourceFileID = 253 and
          e.namespaceID = n.id
- can limit the number of rows returned,
  but the syntax is database-specific
  * in Postgres and MySQL, add "limit {n}" to the end of the select
- Oracle supports regular expressions in queries!
  * example
    select FOO from BAR where regexp_like(BAZ, 'regex-goes-here', 'i')
    - the 'i' makes it case-insensitive

Reset a sequence
- sequences are used to assign sequential ids to new rows
- alter sequence {sequence-name} restart with 1

Joins
- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)
- returns column values from two tables based on
  matching a column value in one table with a column value in another
- the many kinds of joins are described next
- inner
  * the most common, default kind of join
  * finds the intersection between two tables
  * only returns rows in the first table that
    have a corresponding row in the second table
  * rows in the first table will be returned once
    for each matching row in the second table
  * example
    select e.name as eName, s.filename as sName
    from Element e, SourceFile s
    where e.sourceFileID = s.id
    order by eName
    - the names "eName" and "sName" can be used to
      retrieve those columns from the rows in the result set
- left outer
  * returns all rows in the first table
    plus matching rows in the second table
    or null values if there are no matching rows
- right outer
  * returns all rows in the second table
    plus matching rows in the first table
    or null values if there are no matching rows
- full outer
  * returns all rows from both tables
    with matching rows from the other table
    or null values if there are no matching rows
  * some databases don't support this
- cross
  * returns the cartesian product (all possible combinations)
    of rows from two tables

Getting last auto-increment key
- when keys are automatically assigned from a sequence as
  new rows are added, the last key assigned in the current process
  can be obtained using currval()
- steps
  * select currval('sequence_name') as id
  * advance to the first row in the result set that is returned
  * get the integer value of the column named "id"
  
Getting number of rows in a table
- select COUNT(*) as count from table-name
- get value of 'count' as an integer

Checking for duplicate rows
- from Andy Knudsen
  select col1, col2, col3, count(*) from table-name
  group by col1, col2, col3
  having count(*) > 1

Getting the current date/time
  * select CURRENT_DATE from dual
  * retrieve the string value of 'CURRENT_DATE' from the result set
