- in JavaScript: if (require.main === module)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Node Package Manager (npm)
- Node must be installed first
- approach #1
  * curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
- approach #2
  * download .tgz file from http://github.com/isaacs/npm/downloads/
  * unzip it
  * cd to the directory
  * enter "sudo make dev"
  * enter "sudo make link"

To update npm itself
- enter "npm update npm"

To update all installed npm packages
- enter "npm update [-g]"

To get help on npm
- enter "npm help"

To install a module/package
- if only for current project, enter "npm install {module-name}"
  * installs in subdirectory of current directory named "node_modules"
- if for all projects to share, enter "npm install -g {module-name}"
  * installs in /usr/local/lib/node_modules
  * to avoid having to use sudo, enter this once:
    sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
    - sets you as the owner of that directory

To get a list of installed modules
- for the current project, enter "npm ls"
- for shared, enter "npm ls -g"

To create a new package
- create a package.json file that describes it
  * enter "npm help json" for details
  * run "npm init" to have it prompt for details and create the file
    - safe to run in a non-empty directory
...
- enter "npm publish ..."

npm commands include:
  activate adduser build cache coding-style config deactivate developers
  folders help install json link list ln ls npm publish registry restart
  rm scripts start stop tag test uninstall update unpublish

To get help on an npm command
- enter "npm help {command}"

To run a custom script defined in package.json
- enter "npm run {script-name}"

NODE_PATH
- this environment variable is used to locate Node modules
- a good value for this is .:/usr/local/lib/node_modules

To install node-jslint
- run "npm list | grep jslint" to find the latest version
  - it was "jslint@0.0.3"
- run "sudo npm install jslint@0.0.3"

Events module
- EventEmitter
  * don't use 'error' as an event name because
    Node will throw an error if such an event is emitted
    and there is no listener for it

Express module
- http://expressjs.com
- built on top of the connect module
  * http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/
  * see list of "middleware" here
    - passed to express server use method
    - examples include
      basicAuth, directory, errorHandler, favicon, logger, profiler,
      query, session, static
- npm install express

goog Module
- https://github.com/hsch/node-goog
- allows the Google Closure library to be used with Node.js
- provides encryption, geometry, date/time handling, data structures
  and much more
- see installation and usage steps at web page above
- steps to use
  * npm install goog
  * download the Google Closure library separately
    from http://code.google.com/closure/library/
  * set the CLOSURE_BASE_PATH environment variable
    to point to its "goog" directory (end with /!)
- problem
  * this line causes a TypeError ...
    "Cannot call method 'runInNewContext' of undefined"
    goog = require('goog').goog;
- require modules to be used
  * ex. goog.require('goog.structs.Set');

Optimist Module
- provides command-line option parsing
- https://github.com/substack/node-optimist

Socket.IO Module
- http://socket.io/
- see configuration options at
  https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/wiki/Configuring-Socket.IO

Stack Traces
- to print one, call console.trace();
