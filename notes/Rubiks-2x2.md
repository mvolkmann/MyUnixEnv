# Steps to solve Rubik's Cube 2x2

Begin by solving the white layer manually and skipping to step 6 or solve it by performing steps 1-5.

1. Put side with most white squares on bottom.
2. Rotate cube so bottom of piece at bottom-right of front is not white.
3. Rotate top layer so the piece that belongs at the bottom-right of front is above it.
4. Repeatedly execute R U R’ U’ until it moves to where it belongs in the correct rotation.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the bottom layer (white) is solved.
6. Place the white side on the bottom.
   The goal top color is yellow, except in Rubik's Orbit where it is blue.
7. View the top. If there are two adjacent top colors,
   rotate them to the right side of the top face.
   Otherwise put a top color in the bottom left of the top face.
   If there are no top colors, the top face rotation doesn't matter.
8. R U R' U R U\*2 R'
9. Rotate the top face to maximize side matches.
10. Repeat steps 7 and 9 until the top is all the goal color.
11. Rotate the top face to maximize the side color matches.
12. Rotate the cube in your hands so a piece that is in the wrong position
    is at the bottom right of the top face.
13. R' F R' B*2 R F' R B*2 R*2 B*2 (B is back, not bottom!)
14. Repeat steps 12 and 13 until the cube is solved.

OLD STEPS that don't seem to work

7. Rotate top layer until either 1 or 4 pieces are in the correct location.
8. If only 1 piece from step 6 is in the correct location, rotate the cube so it is in the bottom-right of the top face.
9. Execute U R U’ L’ - U R’ U’ L. This moves all the top layer pieces except the one at the bottom-right of the top face. Repeat this until all four top pieces are in the correct location.

10. Flip the cube over so the solved white layer is on top.
11. Rotate the bottom layer so an incorrectly rotated piece is in the bottom-right of the front face.
12. Repeatedly execute step 4 until that piece is correctly rotated (yellow on bottom). The rest of the cube will appear messed up.
13. Repeat steps 11-12 until the cube is solved or will be by rotating the bottom layer.
