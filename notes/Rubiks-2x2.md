# Steps to solve Rubik's Cube 2x2

Begin by solving the white layer manually and skipping to step 6 or solve it by performing steps 1-5.

1. Put side with most white squares on bottom.
2. Rotate cube so bottom of piece at bottom-right of front is not white.
3. Rotate top layer so the piece that belongs at the bottom-right of front is above it.
4. Repeatedly execute R U R’ U’ until it moves to where it belongs in the correct rotation.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the bottom layer (white) is solved.

6. Place the white side on the bottom.
7. Rotate top layer until either 1 or 4 pieces are in the correct location.

8. If only 1 piece from step 6 is in the correct location, rotate the cube so it is in the bottom-right of the top face.
9. Execute U R U’ L’ - U R’ U’ L. This moves all the top layer pieces except the one at the bottom-right of the top face. Repeat this until all four top pieces are in the correct location.

10. Flip the cube over so the solved white layer is on top.
11. Rotate the bottom layer so an incorrectly rotated piece is in the bottom-right of the front face.
12. Repeatedly execute step 4 until that piece is correctly rotated (yellow on bottom). The rest of the cube will appear messed up.
13. Repeat steps 11-12 until the cube is solved or will be by rotating the bottom layer.
