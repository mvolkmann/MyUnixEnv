Firebase Notes

- overview
  * provides data storage
    - store & sync data with a NoSQL cloud database
    - data is stored as JSON
      * maximum depth is 32
    - data is synced to all connected clients in realtime
    - data remains available when app goes offline
  * basic idea
    - data is stored in a tree of nodes
    - can get a "ref" to any node
    - can search and ref for specific children,
      but cannot search deeper descendant nodes
    - can listen for child nodes being added,
      moved (order within parent), removed, and changed
    - listeners a live and learn about future changes
    - search listeners are live and learn about future nodes
      that match the criteria
    - each Firebase app has a web console
      that can be used to view and modify the data
  * provides user authentication
    - using email/password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google,
      anonymous auth, or your own auth system
  * provides static file hosting
    - deploy to a Google server
    - works with SSL certs
    - provides a global CDN
  * can access from web apps, Android apps, and iOS apps
  * has a REST API
  * cost (as of 2/13/16)
    - free for small amounts of data and accesses
      * 100 connections, 1 GB storage, 10 GB transfer, no custom domain
    - monthly fee for larger amounts of data and accesses
      * $5 per month to add a custom domain
      * $49 per month for unlimited connections, 10 GB storage, 50 GB transfer
      * $149 per month for 30 GB storage, 150 GB transfer
      * $449 per month for 100 GB storage, 500 GB transfer
      * $1499 per month for 300 GB storage, 1.5 TB transfer
ASK HOW LARGE THE eP3 DATABASE IS.
    - scales to accommodate the app
      * "Our servers manage millions of concurrent connections
        and billions of operations per month."
  * security
    - "All of your data is transferred over a secure SSL connection
      with a 2048-bit certificate."
    - "Database access and validation is controlled at a granular level
      using our flexible security rules language."
    - "We take care of provisioning the SSL cert for you.:"
  * offline support
    - "Your Firebase app will remain responsive regardless of network latency
      or Internet connectivity.  All writes to a Firebase database will trigger
      local events immediately, before any data has been written to the server.
      Once connectivity is re-established, the client will receive any changes
      it missed, synchronizing it with the current server state."
  * deployment
    - "Deploy using the Firebase command line tools and
      roll back to previous versions with one click."
    - "Every app gets its own firebaseapp.com domain,
      and paid apps can deploy to a custom domain."
- to create an account
  * https://www.firebase.com/login/

- using from JavaScript
  * to load library
    <script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.1/firebase.js"></script>
  * also load your JavaScript code
    <script src="my-file.js"></script>
  * to obtain a reference
    const fbRef = new Firebase('https://{some-code}.firebaseIO.com/');
  * to set the db to an object
    fbRef.set(obj);
  * to add an object to a list
    fbRef.push(obj);
  * to listen for objects being added to a list
    fbRef.on('child_added', snapshot => {
      const obj = snapshot.val();
      // Do something with obj.
    });
  * to deploy a web app
    - npm install -g firebase-tools
    - firebase login
      * if you set up the account with Google,
        press the Sign in with Google" button
        instead of entering a username and password in the text fields
    - firebase init
      * prompts for Firebase to use and
        directory for public root (defaults to "public")
      * creates firebase.json
    - firebase deploy
    - to use the app, browse https://scorching-fire-8631.firebaseapp.com
    - to configure the app, browse https://scorching-fire-8631.firebaseio.com
  * to open a web app in the default browser
    - firebase open
  * reading data
    - when a node is read, all of it's children (descendants?) are read
  * events
    - to listen for a value change to a ref,
      ref.on('value', snapshot => {
        const value = snapshot.val();
      });
    - to listen for a child of a ref being added,
      ref.on('child_added', (snapshot, prevChildKey) => {
        const value = snapshot.val();
      });
    - to listen for a child of a ref being modified,
      ref.on('child_changed', snapshot => {
        const value = snapshot.val();
      });
    - to listen for a child of a ref being removed,
      ref.on('child_removed', snapshot => {
        const value = snapshot.val();
      });
    - to listen for a child of a ref being moved
      to a different position in list of children,
      ref.on('child_moved', snapshot => {
        const value = snapshot.val();
      });
    - to only listen for the first event of a given kind,
      call ref.once instead of ref.on
    - to remove a listener (a.k.a. detach a callback)
      ref.off(event, callback);
    - to remove all listeners for a given event,
      ref.off(event);
    - to remove all listeners for all events,
      ref.off();
  * querying
    - to construct a query from a given ref,
      * first, specify how results should be ordered by calling one of these:
        - orderByChild(child-name) - when values are objects
          that should be ordered on a given child value
          * this also specifies the property being searched
            by startAt (prefix search)
        - orderByKey() - key value must be a number or string
        - orderByValue()
        - orderByPriority() - priorities are numbers or strings assigned to nodes
        - Is there a default order?
      * second, specify the query by calling
        limitToFirst(), limitToLast(),
        startAt(), endAt(), and/or equalTo()
      * third, register a listener to get results
        using "on" or "once" method
- see example in programming/Firebase/demo-app
  * to run
    - node server.js
    - browse localhost:1919
  * query capabilities are quite limited
  * this may rule out use of Firebase for many apps
  * cannot search on multiple properties
  * cannot perform joins across collections
