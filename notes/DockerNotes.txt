Docker Notes

See your start on a SETT article in
~/Documents/OCI/SETT/docker-article/article.html.

- Docker Engine: supports sharing Docker images
- docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello from the whale!

To start Docker on Mac OS X
- if there is no whale icon in the
  status bar at the top of the screen
  * open Launchpad or Finder/Applications
  * click Docker icon (whale)
  * should see Docker icon in status bar at top
- if there is a whale icon
  * click it a verify that the dropdown says "Docker is running"

To set Docker preferences
- click the whale icon in the status bar
- select "Preferences"
- General options include:
  * "Automatically start Docker when you log in" (on by default)
  * "Automatically check for updates" (on by default)
  * "Exclude VM from Time Machine backups" (off by default)
  * number of CPUs
  * amount of memory allocated
- can configure proxies
- can configure file sharing with the host machine
- can initiate uninstall

Kitematic
- a graphical UI for Docker
- can be installed from the Docker whale menu

To determine if Docker is running and see other info
- docker info

Images
- to define
  * create a new directory and cd to it
  * create a file name "Dockerfile"
  * comments in this file begin with #
  * first instruction must be "FROM {image-name}[:tag]"
    to specify the base image
    - tag defaults to "latest",
      but can specify a different version
    - the smallest, simplest base image is "scratch",
      but that doesn't seem to be able to do anything
    - another good option is "bash"
    - official Node base images are described at
      https://hub.docker.com/_/node/
      * specify npm packages to be installed in package.json
      * run a command to install PostgreSQL?
IMPORTANT!
      * SEE https://hub.docker.com/r/spittet/node-postgresql/
    - official PostgreSQL base images are described at
      https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/
    - there doesn't seem to be an offical base image
      that includes Express
  * RUN command
    - executes command(s) in a new layer
      and creates a new image
    - often used to install software packages
    - to install software in the image, add lines like this:
      RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y {software-name}
  * CMD command
    - sets the default command and/or parameters
    - can be overwritten from command line when running
    - only the last CMD command is used,
      so there is no point in having more than one
    - typically used to start a server
    - to run a command, add the line "CMD {command}"
  * ENTRYPOINT command
    - configures a container that will run as an executable
  * RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT can be used in "shell" or "exec" form
    - in shell form the command is
      executed with "/bin/sh -c {command}"
      * ex. CMD echo "Hello, World!"
    - in exec form an executable is
      executed directly with no shell processing
      * ex. CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello, World!"]
      * exec form is preferred for the CMD and ENTRYPOINT commands
  * save the file
- to build an image
 * docker build [-t {name[:tag]}] {Dockerfile-path}
   - if -t option is omitted,
     the image will have no name (a.k.a. repository)
     or tag, just an id
   - Dockerfile-path can be . for the current directory
   - also downloads and builds image for the base image
     if it doesn't already exist
     * ex. bash and node
     * can take a long time, but subsequent builds are
       much faster because the base image
       is already downloaded and built
   - if you build an image with the same name
     as an existing image, it will not be replaced,
     but it will lose its name so
     the name can be assigned to the new image
     * referred to as a "dangling image"
     * can delete it by its id or with this command:
       docker rmi $(docker images -qa -f "dangling=true")
     * why isn't there a build option to do this automatically?
- to list existing images
  * docker images
- to remove an image
  * docker rmi {image-name-or-id}
    - can use shortest length of image id that is unique
  * not allowed if image is currently running in a container

Containers
- to list
  * only running: docker ps
  * all: docker ps -a
  * only latest created: docker ps -l
- to create, but not start: docker create
- to create and start: docker run {image-name}
  * docker run {image-name}
    - options
      -i : is for interactive (can read from stdin)
      -t : allocates a pseudo TTY
      --rm : removes container after image exits
      --name {container-name} : gives name to container
  * if the image isn't found locally,
    this attempts to download it from "Docker Hub"
    - download images are saved locally for future use
    - can remove when no longer needed
  * every time this is run, a new container is created
  * after this completes, the new container remains
    unless the --rm option is used
    - I think you want this for non-server images
- to stop and restart a running container:
  docker restart {container-id}
- to rename: docker rename {container-id} {new-name}
- to delete: docker rm {container-id}
  * can use shortest length of container id
    that is unique
- containers are process-centric
  * once the image inside it exits, the container is done
  * so why does it still exist?
    - may to allow view its logs

- to stop a running container
  * docker stop {container-id}
- to output logs from a running container
  * docker logs {container-name}
- to show processes running inside a running container
  * docker top {container-name}
- to run a command inside a running container
  * docker exec {container-name} {command}
  * one use is to inspect the contents of a database
- to copy a file into a running container
- docker cp {file-path} {container-name}:/{new-file-name}
- to open a bash shell running inside a running container
  * docker exec -it {container-name} /bin/bash
  * useful to poke around at the state

- to get information about an image or container
  * docker inspect {name-or-id}
    - Monsanto container-name is "capacity-api"

Docker Compose
- a toole for defining multi-container applications
- Does Monsanto use this?
- to start an image
  * How is this different than loading into a container?
  * cd to a directory containing docker-compose.yml
  * docker-compose up -d
    * -d (daemon) avoids taking over the current process
- to stop an image
  * cd to a directory containing docker-compose.yml
  * docker-compose down
