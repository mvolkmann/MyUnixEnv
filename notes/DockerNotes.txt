Docker Notes

Terminology
- image: a filesystem and parameters to use at runtime
  that doesn’t have state and never changes
  * images can run a set of commands and exit
  * images can continue running until stopped
    - examples include REST servers, web servers, and databases
- container: a running instance of an image
- Docker Engine: supports sharing Docker images
- Docker Hub: a repository of Docker images
  * browse https://hub.docker.com/ to search for them
  * ex. docker/whalesay

To install on Mac OS X
- browse https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/
- download a .dmg file
- double-click it
- in the install dialog, drag Docker.app to the Applications folder

To verify the installation
- docker run hello-world
- docker run docker/whalesay

To start Docker on Mac OS X
- if there is no whale icon in the status bar at the top of the screen
  * open Launchpad
  * click Docker icon (whale)
  * should see Docker icon in status bar at top
- if there is a whale icon
  * click it a verify that the dropdown says "Docker is running"

To set Docker preferences
- click the whale icon in the status bar
- select "Preferences"
- General options include:
  * "Automatically start Docker when you log in" (on by default)
  * "Automatically check for updates" (on by default)
  * "Exclude VM from Time Machine backups" (off by default)
  * number of CPUs
  * amount of memory allocated
- can configure proxies
- can configure file sharing with the host machine
- can initiate uninstall

To determine if Docker is running and see other info
- docker info

To load an image into a container and run it
- docker run {image-name}
  * if the image isn't found locally,
    this attempts to download it from "Docker Hub"
- how is "docker run -it {image-name}" different?
  * -i is for interactive (can read from stdin)
  * -t allocates a pseudo TTY

To start a Docker image
- cd to a directory containing docker-compose.yml
- docker-compose up -d
  * -d (daemon) avoids taking over the current process

To stop a Docker image
- cd to a directory containing docker-compose.yml
- docker-compose down

To get information about Docker images that are running
- docker ps [-l] [-q]

To get information about all Docker images,
including those that have been stopped
- docker ps -a

To get information about all locally installed Docker images
- docker images

To remove a Docker image
- docker rmi {image-id}
- THIS DOESN'T WORK!

To get lots of imformation about a running image
- docker inspect {container-name}
- container-name is capacity-api

To output logs from a running image
- docker logs {container-name}

To show processes running inside a running image
- docker top {container-name}

To run commands inside a Docker image
- docker exec {container-name} {command}

To copy a file into a Docker image
- docker cp {file-path} {container-name}:/{new-file-name}

To open a bash shell running inside a Docker image
- docker exec -it {container-name} /bin/bash

To create a Docker image
- create a new directory and cd to it
- create a file name "Dockerfile"
- comments in this file begin with #
- the first instruction must be FROM to specify the base image
- specify the base image with "FROM {image-name}:{tag}"
  * tag defaults to "latest"
  * the smallest, simplest base image is "scratch",
    but that doesn't seem to be able to do anything
  * another good option is "bash"
- RUN executes command(s) in a new layer and creates a new image
  * often used to install software packages
  * to install software in the image, add lines like this:
    RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y {software-name}
- CMD sets the default command and/or parameters
  * can be overwritten from command line when running
  * only the last CMD command is used,
    so there is no point in having more than one
  * typically used to start a server
  * to run a command, add the line "CMD {command}"
- ENTRYPOINT configures a container that will run as an executable
- RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT can be used in "shell" or "exec" form
  * in shell form the command is executed with "/bin/sh -c {command}"
    - ex. CMD echo "Hello, World!"
  * in exec form an executable is executed directly with no shell processing
    - ex. CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello, World!"]
    - exec form is preferred for the CMD and ENTRYPOINT commands
- save the file
- to build the image, enter "docker build -t {image-name} ."
  * how does this differ from running "docker build ."?
