Husky Notes

Overview
- Husky supports specifying git hooks in a project package.json.
- https://github.com/typicode/husky

To install in a project
- npm install --save-dev husky

Example hook
- add this line to scripts section in package.json
  "precommit": "npm run lint && CI=true npm test"
  * "CI=true" is specific to the Jest test framework
    - it tells Jest to run all the tests,
      as opposed to only those that changed since the last run
    - it prevents Jest from running the tests in watch mode
- now every time "git commit" is run (or your "ci" alias)
  the lint and test scripts are run first
- if either fail, the commit is not allowed

To skip running hooks
- git commit --no-verify
  or just
  git commit -n
