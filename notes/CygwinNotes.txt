Cygwin Notes

XTerm setup
- in Cygwin setup program, install xorg-server and xinit
  * both are in the X11 category
- create .Xresources file in home directory
  containing the following:
  Xft*antialias: true
  XTerm*background: black
  XTerm*foreground: white
  XTerm*faceName: BitStream Vera Sans Mono
  XTerm*faceSize: 12
- xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
- restart XWin Server from Start menu
- open a Cygwin window
- enter "xterm"
  * if you get "Xt error: Can't open display",
    maybe you forgot to start the XWin Server
- select Main Options...Toolbar to hide it
- make the window full-screen

clearing screen
- create clear.c containing the following:
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void) { printf("\033[2J"); }
- compile this with gcc -o clear.exe clear.c
