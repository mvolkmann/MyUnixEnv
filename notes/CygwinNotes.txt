  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void) { printf("\033[2J"); }

- enter "clear" to clear a Cygwin window

  ncftp -u username -p password target-host
- to save a bookmark
  * enter "bye"
  * it will reply with "You have not saved a bookmark for this site.
    Would you like to ..."
  * answer "yes"
  * it will reply with "Enter a name for this bookmark:"
  * enter a short name you'll remember
  * it will ask if you want to save the password
