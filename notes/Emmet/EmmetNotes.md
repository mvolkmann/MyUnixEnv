# Emmet Notes

## Overview

Emmet is an editor plugin for quickly entering HTML, XML, and CSS.
It also supports many "actions" that operate on HTML and XML elements.
The most commonly used action is to expand an abbreviation or snippet.

Emmet was created by Sergey Chikuyonok.
The original name was "Zen Coding".

Emmet is available for many editors including
Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio (VS) Code, and WebStorm.
However, some implementations do not support
all the defined snippets and actions.

Emmet is not just a simple snippet manager.
It parses entered text to extract meaning.
These kinds of snippets are refered to as "dynamic snippets".

We will see many examples later, but here's one.
The snippet `div#some-id.class1.class2[attr1=one attr2=2]{some content}`
expands to
`<div id="some-id" class="class1 class2" attr1="one" attr2="2">some content</div>`.
Amazing!
Simpler snippets are also very useful.
For example, the CSS snippet `mb10` expands to `margin-bottom: 10px;`.

The main web site for Emmet is [https://emmet.io/](https://emmet.io/).
Also see the cheat sheet at [https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/).

## Getting Started

You will need to configure Emmet within your editor/IDE of choice.
Instructions for specific ones can be found at [https://emmet.io/download/](https://emmet.io/download/).
Click the box for your editor to see the details.

Rather than walk through the steps for every editor,
this article covers just two.
Currently VS Code seems to be the most popular editor, so that is covered.
I use Vim, so that is also covered.

For instructions in other popular editors, see below:
- Atom: [https://atom.io/packages/emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet).
- Sublime Text: [https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#readme](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#readme).
- Webstorm: [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/enabling-emmet-support.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/enabling-emmet-support.html)
- IntelliJ: [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-emmet-support.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-emmet-support.html)

## VS Code

Details on configuring Emmet for VS Code can be found at
[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet.)
VS Code includes Emmet by default, enabled for these file types:
css, haml, html, jade, jsx, less, sass, scss, slim, stylus, xml, and xsl.
More file types can be added.

### Configuring Emmet in VS Code

* Open Preferences...Settings from the "File" menu in Windows and Linux,
  or the "Code" menu in macOS.
* Enter "Emmet" in the "Search Settings" input at the top.
* Note the available settings and their defaults on the left.
* Change settings in "USER SETTINGS" on the right.
* To enable use in React components in `.js` files
  change the "emmet.includeLanguages" object
  to include `javascript: 'javascriptreact'`

### Using Emmet in VS Code

Suggestions are displayed as snippets are typed along with non-Emmet suggestions.
To use the top suggestion before the snippet is fully entered,
press enter or tab.
To use a different suggestion, use to the up and down arrows keys
to navigate to it and press enter or tab.
The expansion for the highlighted Emmet suggestion is displayed
in a "documentation fly-out" to the right of the suggestion
so you know what will be inserted before selected it.

![VS Code screenshot](https://github.com/mvolkmann/MyUnixEnv/blob/master/notes/Emmet/Emmet-VSCode.png?raw=true)

The cursor will automatically be moved to
an insertion point within the expansion.
For snippets with multiple insertion points,
after entering a value in one
press tab to jump to the next one.

### Vim emulation in VS Code

In case you are interested in enabling Vim emulation in VS Code,
here are the steps.
* Select View...Extensions.
* Enter "vscodevim" in the search input.
* Press the "Install" button for the vscodevim extension.

To configure Vim emulation
* Select Code...Preferences...Settings.
* Enter "vim" in the "Search Settings" input at the top.
* See the available settings and their defaults on the left.
* Change settings in "USER SETTINGS" on the right.

## Vim

The Emmet plugin for Vim is available at
[https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim.](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim.)
Instructions for installing it using a variety of
Vim plugin managers can be found there,
as are configuration details.
Configuration is accomplished by modifying your `.vimrc` file.

All keyboard shortcuts for Emmet commands begin with &lt;emmet-leader>.
By default this is ctrl-y.
The most commonly used keyboard shortcut expands a snippet.
The key sequence that triggers this is <emmet-leader> followed by a comma.

To change the value of <emmet-leader>, set the variable g:user_emmet_leader_key.
For example, to change it to the space key, add the following:
```
let g:user_emmet_leader_key='<space>'
```

Once these changes are made, Emmet expansions can be triggered
by entering a snippet and pressing space followed by a comma
while still in insert mode.

For snippets with more than one insertion point
press `<emmet-leader>n` to move to next one
and `<emmet-leader>N` to move to previous one.

By default Emmet snippets can be expanded in all file types.
To restrict usage to specific file types, add the following.
```
let g:user_emmet_install_global = 0 " don't enable for all file types
autocmd FileType html,css,scss EmmetInstall " specifies file types
```

To use Emmet in .js or .jsx files that define React components,
add the following.
```
let g:user_emmet_settings = {'javascript.jsx': {'extends': 'jsx'}}
autocmd FileType html,css,javascript.jsx,scss EmmetInstall
```

## Syntax for HTML snippets

The syntax for specifying HTML snippets is
mostly like CSS selector syntax, with no spaces.

In the examples that follow, **I will be showing the cursor position
after triggering the snippet using the `|` symbol**.

Child elements are specified with the `>` character.
For example, `foo>bar>baz` expands to
```html
<foo>
  <bar>
    <baz>|</baz>
  </bar>
</foo>
```

Sibling elements are specified with the `+` character.
For example, `foo+bar+baz` expands to
```html
<foo>|</foo>
<bar></bar>
<baz></baz>
```

Climb up the element hierarchy within a snippet using the `^` character.
This adds a sibling to the parent of the last element that was generated.
For example, `table>tr>th+th^tr>td+td` expands to
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
However the same result can be achieved using parentheses instead of `^`.
The equivalent snippet is<br />
`table>(tr>th+th)+(tr>td+td)`.
Perhaps this is easier to understand.
Even easier would be to enter this as multiple snippets
rather than trying to reason about how to use just one.

Multiple `^` characters can be used to climb up multiple levels, but
that results in snippets that are difficult to understand at a glance.

CSS class names are specified with the `.` character.
For example, `div.my-class` expands to
```html
<div class="my-class">|</div>
```
and `div.c1.c2` expands to
```html
<div class="c1 c2">|</div>
```

Element ids are specified with the `#` character.
For example, `div#my-id` expands to
```html
<div id="my-id">|</div>
```

Attributes are specified between square brackets.
Values with no special characters do not require quotes.
If special characters are present, enclose attribute values
in single or double quotes.
For example, `div[foo=1 bar=two]` expands to
```html
<div foo="1" bar="two">|</div>
```
and `div[foo="contains space" bar='single quotes']` expands to
```html
<div foo="contains space" bar="single quotes"></div>
```
Note that no commas are used between the listed attributes.

Element content is specified betweeen curly braces.
For example, `div{my content}` expands to
```html
<div>my content|</div>
```

Elements in a snippet can be repeated with the `*` character
followed by a number.  For example, `td*3` expands to
```html
<td>|</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
```

Incrementing numbers can be added in repeated content
with the `$` character.
This can use for ids, classes, and content.
For example, `ul>li.item$*3` expands to
```html
<ul>
  <li class="item1">|</li>
  <li class="item2"></li>
  <li class="item3"></li>
</ul>
```
Numbering starts at 1 by default.
A different starting value can be specified with `@start` and `*times`.
For example, `div{item $@4}*3` expands to
```html
<div>item 4|</div>
<div>item 5</div>
<div>item 6</div>
```

The syntax described above can be combined
to create more powerful snippets.
For example, `div#my-id.my-class[foo=1 bar=two]{my content}` expands to
```html
<div id="my-id" class="my-class" foo="1" bar="two">my content|</div>
```

Parts of snippets can be groups using parentheses.
This is useful for repeating specific sections.
For example, `table>(thead>tr>th*3)+(tbody>(tr>td*3)*2)` expands to
```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>|</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Emmet can sometimes guess desired tag names based on context.
These are called "implicit tag names".
For example, `.foo` expands to
```html
<div class="foo">|</div>
```
and `ul>.foo` expands to
```html
<ul>
  <li class="foo">|</li>
</ul>
```

## Lorem Ipsum text

"Lorem Ipsum" is scrambled Latin text that is frequently used
as a placeholder for text that will be supplied later.
Emmet can generate this text.
By default it generates 100 words,
but the number of desired words can be specified.

The snippet is the word "lorem" or the word "lipsum",
optionally followed by a number.
For example, `lorem` and `lipsum` expand to 100 words,
while `lorem3` and `lipsum3` expand to 3 words.
The words selected are random, but here is an example:
```
Sit debitis aliquam.
```

## HTML snippets

Emmet supports a large number of HTML snippets.
The ones show below seem the most useful.

`!` expands to a common HTML template.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>
  |
</body>

## Actions

The tables below describe Emmet actions and
the keys to trigger them in VS Code and Vim.
For Windows and Linux, substitute "ctrl" wherever you see "cmd".

In VS Code all Emmet actions can be selected from the "Command Pallete"
which is opened by pressing cmd-P.
None of these commands have a default keybinding.

![VS Code Command Palette](https://github.com/mvolkmann/MyUnixEnv/blob/master/notes/Emmet/VSCodeCommandPalette.png?raw=true)

To add keybindings in VS Code, open Preferences...Keyboard Shortcuts
from the "File" menu in Windows and Linux, or the "Code" menu in macOS.
Enter "Emmet" in the search input at the top to
filter the commands to just those supplied by Emmet.
Select a command and press the "+" that appears to its left.
Finally, type the shortcut key sequence to be associated with the command and press enter.

![VS Code Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/mvolkmann/MyUnixEnv/blob/master/notes/Emmet/VSCodeKeyboardShortcuts.png?raw=true)

VS Code allows keybindings to be added to commands
even if the keybinding is already assigned to another command.
To determine if a keybinding has been assigned to multiple commands,
right-click any command that uses it and select "Show Conflicts".

In the tables below, the "VS Code Key" column shows suggested shortcut keys,
but none of these are configured by default.

### Commonly Used Actions

| Action | Description | VS Code Key | Vim Key |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| expand abbreviation | the primary action | enter or tab | <emmet-leader> comma in insert mode |

| increment number by .1 | adds to number under cursor | ctrl-opt-up arrow | not supported |
| decrement number by .1 | subtracts from number under cursor | ctrl-opt-down arrow | not supported |

### Less Commonly Used Actions

| Action | Description | VS Code Key | Vim Key |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| evaluate math expression | replaces the math expression under cursor with result | cmd-Y | not supported |
| encode/decode image to data:URL | toggles CSS url function value between a file path and a data: URL | cmd-I | not supported |
| reflect CSS value | copies CSS value under cursor to all vendor-prefixed variations in same rule | cmd-b | not supported |
| update image size | adds width and height attributes to the img tag under cursor | cmd-U | <emmet-leader> i, but doesn't work |

### Non-standard Actions

These are actions that are not described at [https://docs.emmet.io](https://docs.emmet.io),
but are implemented by either VS Code or vim-emmet.

| Action | Description | VS Code Key | Vim Key |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| update tag | changes tag under cursor; will prompt for new tag | cmd-c | not supported |
| anchorize URL | changes URL under cursor to an anchor tag using that URL; must start with http:// or https:// | not supported | <emmet-leader> a in insert mode |

### "split/join tag" example

With the cursor over the start tag of the element `foo`,
this would change `<foo><bar>baz</bar></foo>`
to `<foo />`.

## Custom snippets

Many Emmet plugins support user-defined custom snippets.
For more information about these,
see [https://docs.emmet.io/customization/](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/).

## Summary

Emmet can save web developers a lot of time.
Once you learn the basic syntax, it's pretty easy to use.
Give it a try in your favorite editor!
