<https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/january-2019-way-to-go-part-2>.
It provides details on all the syntax in the Go language.

Future articles will cover concurrency, reflection,
solutions to common tasks, modules, testing, and the future of Go.

## Standard Library

### Builtins

The builtin constants, variables, and functions provided by Go
are listed as being in the standard library package "builtin"
for documentation purposes but no such package actually exists.

The following sections describe each of the provided builtins.

### Builtin Constants

The provided constants include
the boolean literals `true` and `false`, and `iota`.

`iota` is not actually a constant.
It is a global counter that is set to zero
at the beginning of every `const` definition,
which is the only place it can be used.

The value of `iota` is incremented by one after each line in the
`const` definition except for blank lines and comment lines.
It is typically used to define enumerated values.
The last expression involving `iota` is repeated for subsequent
constant values but uses an incremented value of `iota`.
For example:

```go
const (
  red   = iota // 0
  green        // 1
  blue         // 2
)

const (
  north = iota + 1 // iota = 0, 0 + 1 = 1
  south            // iota = 1, 1 + 1 = 2
  east             // iota = 2, 2 + 1 = 3
  west             // iota = 3, 3 + 1 = 4
)

const (
  t1 = iota * 3 // iota = 0, 0 * 3 = 0
  t2            // iota = 1, 1 * 3 = 3
  t3            // iota = 2, 2 * 3 = 6
)

const (
  _        = iota             // iota = 0, ignore first value
  kb int64 = 1 << (10 * iota) // iota = 1, 1 shifted left 10 places, 1024
  mb                          // iota = 2, 1 shifted left 20 places, 1048576
  gb                          // iota = 3, 1 shifted left 30 places, 1073741824
)

// Silly example
const (
  apple  = 9        // iota = 0
  banana = 8        // iota = 1
  cherry = iota + 3 // iota = 2, value = 2 + 3 = 5
  date              // iota = 3, value = 3 + 6 = 6
)
```

### Builtin Variables

There is only one provided variable, named `nil`.
This is the zero value for a
pointer, channel, func, interface, map, or slice.
For example,
the current value of all the variables below is nil.

```go
var ptr *string         // pointer

var c chan string       // channel

type stringToString func(string) string
var f stringToString    // function

var i error             // interface

var m map[string]string // map

var s []string          // slice
```

### Builtin Types

Go defines the following builtin "basic types".

- `bool`\
  The only values are the builtin constants `true` and `false`.
  These can be used with the operators `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
- `byte`\
  This is an alias for the type `uint8`.
- `complex64` and `complex128`\
  These are used to represent complex numbers
  with a specified number of bits.
- `float32` and `float64`\
  These are used to represent floating-point numbers
  with a specified number of bits.
  `float64` is preferred in most cases.
- `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`:
  These are used to represent signed integers
  with a specified number of bits.
  The type `int` is at least 32 bits.
  Its size is based on the word size of the host platform,
  32 bits on 32-bit systems and
  64 bits on 64-bit systems.
  `int` is preferred in many cases.
- `uint`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`\
  These are used to represent unsigned integers
  with a specified number of bits.
  The type `uint` is at least 32 bits.
- `uintptr`\
  This type can hold any kind of pointer.
- `rune`\
  This is an alias for `int32`.
  It is used for unicode characters
  that range in size from 1 to 4 bytes (a.k.a. Unicode code point).
  Literal values of this type are surrounded by single quotes.
- `string`\
  This is a sequence of 8-bit bytes, not Unicode characters.
  However, the bytes are often used to represent Unicode characters.

Go defines the type `error` to represent an error condition.
Variables of this type have the value `nil` when there is no error.

Non-basic types include aggregate, reference, and interface types.
Aggregate types include arrays and structs.
Reference types include pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels.

### Documentation Types

Despite Go not currently supporting generic types,
the following "generic type" names that are not real types
appear in the Go documentation.

- `Type` - represents a specific type for a given function invocation
- `Type1` - like `Type` but for a second type
- `ComplexType` - represents a complex64 or complex128
- `FloatType` - represents a float32 or float64
- `IntegerType` - represents any integer type

### Builtin Functions

#### Data Structure Functions

- `append(slice []Type, elems ...Type) []Type`\
  This appends elements to the end of a slice and returns the updated slice.
- `cap(v Type) int`\
  This returns the capacity of of a string, array, slice, or map.
- `copy(dst, src []Type) int`\
  This copies elements from a source slice to a destination slice
  and returns the number of elements copied.
- `delete(m map[Type]Type1, key Type)`\
  This deletes a key/value pair from a map.
- `len(v Type) int`\
  This returns the length of a string, array, slice, or map
- `make(t Type, size ...IntegerType) Type`\
  This allocates and initializes a slice, map, or channel.\
  If Type is Slice, pass the length, and optional capacity.\
  If Type is Map, optionally specify the number of key/value pairs for which to allocate space.
  See the "Channel Functions" section below for details on using `make` to create a `Channel`.
- `new(Type) *Type`\
  This allocates memory for a given type and returns a pointer to it.

#### Output Functions

- `print(args ...Type)`\
  This writes to stderr; useful for debugging.
- `println(args ...Type)`\
  This is like `print` but adds a newline at the end.
- To write to stdout, see the `fmt` package.

#### Error Handling Functions

See the "Error Handling" section of the
[second article](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/january-2019-way-to-go-part-2)
in this series for more detail on these.

- `panic(v interface{})`\
  This stops normal execution of the current goroutine.\
  It is somewhat like a `throw` in other languages.\
  Control cascades upward through the call stack.\
  When it reaches the top, the program is terminated and an error is reported.\
  This can be controlled by the `recover` function.
- `recover`\
  This should be called inside a deferred function to stop the panic sequence\
  and restore normal execution.
  It is somewhat like a `catch` in other languages.

#### Channel Functions

Channels will be covered in detail in a future article on concurrency.

- `close(c chan<-)`\
  This closes a channel after the last sent value is received.
- `make(Channel [, buffer-capacity])`\
  This creates a channel.\
  The channel is unbuffered if `buffer-capacity` is omitted or is zero.

#### Complex Number Functions

- `complex(real, imag FloatType) ComplexType`\
  This creates a complex value from two floating-point values
  that represent the real and imaginary parts.
- `imag(c ComplexType) FloatType`\
  This returns the imaginary part of a complex number.
- `real(c ComplexType) FloatType`\
  This returns the real part of a complex number.

### Type Conversions

No type conversions are performed implicitly.
For example, non-boolean values are not automatically converted
to booleans to allow them to be used in a boolean context.

Many builtin types can be used as conversion functions.
For example, `float32(value)` converts any numeric type to a `float32`
and `int(value)` converts any numeric type to an `int`,
truncating any fractional part.

The `bool` type cannot be used as a function
to convert other basic types to a boolean.
For example, if `n` is a variable that holds an `int`,
`bool(n)` results in a compile-time error
and does not return true or false.
To obtain a boolean value from a number,
use an expression like `n != 0`.

In numeric conversions, if the value is too large to fit
in the target type, the value will be changed.
For example, in `i := 1234; j := int8(i)` the value of `j`
will be -46 because 1234 is too large to fit in an `int8`.

Using the builtin primitive types as conversion functions
will trigger an error if the conversion cannot be performed.
For example, attempting to convert a string to an int is an error,
even if the string contains a valid number.

To convert the string representation of a number to a number,
use the `strconv` package. For example,

```go
s := "19"
i, err := strconv.ParseInt(s, 10, 32) // base 10, bitsize 32

s = "3.14"
f, err := strconv.ParseFloat(s, 65) // bitsize 64
```

When a value is held in an interface type,
a type assertion can be used to convert it to a non-interface type.
This includes the "any" type `interface{}`.
For example, `var f = value.(float32)` converts
a value with an interface type to a `float32`.
This only works if the value actually has a type of `float32`.
See the "Type Assertions" section of the
[second article](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/january-2019-way-to-go-part-2)
in this series for more detail.

In addition to the standard library,
also see the "sub-repositories" that are part of the Go project,
but maintained outside the main repository.
A good starting place is <https://godoc.org/-/subrepo>.

The following sections provide examples
of using some of the standard libraries.

#### Formatting

The standard library package `fmt` defines many functions
that read and write formatted messages.

Functions that read have names that start with `Scan`.
Functions that write have names that start with `Print`.

The most commonly used functions in this package include:

- `fmt.Errorf(format string, args ...interface{}) error`\
   This creates an error value containing a formatted message.

- `fmt.Printf(format string, args ...interface{})`\
  This writes a formatted string to stdout.

- `fmt.Println(args ...interface{})`\
  This writes the string representation of each of the arguments
  to stdout, separated by spaces and followed by a newline.

Format strings can contain placeholders that begin with a percent sign.
These are referred to as "verbs". Commonly used verbs include:

- `%d` for decimal values (includes all the integer types)
- `%f` for floating point values
- `%s` for strings
- `%t` for boolean values to output "true" or "false"
- `%p` for pointers (prints hex address of a variable)
- `%v` for any value in its default format
- `%+v` is similar to `%v` but includes struct field names
- `%T` to output the type of a value

It is common for format strings to end with `\n`
to output a newline character.

For example, to output a number indented by
the number spaces specified in the variable `indent`,

```go
indent := 4
number := 19
fmt.Printf("%*s%d\n", indent, "", number)
// outputs "    19" without the quotes
```

Asterisks can be added to some verbs to
control the number of characters output.
These include `%*s`, `%*d`, `%*f`, and `%*.*f`.
These consume one value for each asterisk
and the value to be formatted.

For strings the minimum number of characters to output
can be specified.
Spaces are added to the beginning or end.
For example, `fmt.Printf("%*s", 5, "abc")` outputs two spaces,
followed by `abc` for a total of five characters.
`fmt.Printf("%-*s", 5, "abc")` outputs `abc`
followed two spaces for a total of five characters.
Note that `fmt.Printf("%*s", 3, "abcdef")` outputs `abcdef`
without truncating.

For decimal values a minimum number of characters to output
can be specified.
When fewer are needed, preceding spaces are added.
For example, `fmt.Printf("%*d", 5, 123)` outputs two spaces,
followed by `123` for a total of five characters.
Note that `fmt.Printf("%*d", 3, 12345)` outputs `12345`
without truncating.

For floating point values the total number of characters to output
and the number of characters after the decimal point can be specified.
For example, `fmt.Printf("%*.2f", 5, 3.456)` outputs a space
followed by `3.46` for a total of five characters.
The number of characters after the decimal point
can be specified with an argument.
`fmt.Printf("%*.*f", 5, 2, 3.456)` outputs the same.

#### Command-line Flags

The standard library package `flags` supports
documenting and parsing command-line flags for an application.
Each flag is described by a type, name,
default value, and documentation string.
The type can be any builtin primitive type
or a user-defined type (using `flag.Var`).

For example, here is a simple application
in a file named `flag-demo.go` that outputs a
range of integer values with a given string prefix.

```go
package main

import (
  "flag"
  "fmt"
)

// These pointers will be set after flag.Parse is called.
// There are flag functions for all the primitive data types.
var minPtr = flag.Int("min", 1, "minimum value")
var maxPtr = flag.Int("max", 10, "maximum value")
var prefixPtr = flag.String("prefix", "", "prefix")

func main() {
  flag.Parse()
  prefix := *prefixPtr
  for i := *minPtr; i <= *maxPtr; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%s%d\n", prefix, i)
  }
}
```

To build this, enter `go build`.

To get help on the flags,
enter `./flag-demo --help` which outputs:

```text
Usage of ./flags:
  -max int
        maximum value (default 10)
  -min int
        minimum value (default 1)
  -prefix string
        prefix
```

Flag names are preceded by a single dash,
followed by `=` or a space, and a value.

To run this, enter one of the following lines:

```text
./flag-demo -min 3 -max 5 -prefix foo
./flag-demo -min=3 -max=5 -prefix=foo
```

both of which output

```text
foo3
foo4
foo5
```

If an invalid value is used for any of the flags,
an error message is displayed, followed by the help output.
For example, if a non-integer value such as "x" is
specified for the max flag, the following error message is output:

```text
invalid value "x" for flag -max: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "x": invalid syntax
```

#### Input/Output

The standard library package `io` defines
the `Reader` and `Writer` interfaces.

##### Readers

The `Reader` interface has a single method `Read`.
This reads from an underlying data stream,
populates a byte slice, and
returns the number of bytes read or an error.
For example, the error is `io.EOF`
if the end of a stream is reached.

There are many implementations of this interface in the standard library,
including ones for reading from strings, files, and network connections.

To read from a string, see <https://tour.golang.org/methods/21>.

One way to read from a file is to use the package `io/ioutil`
which defines a `ReadFile` function.
This reads the entire file in one call.

For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  // Read entire file into a newly created byte array.
  bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile("haiku.txt")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(bytes))
}
```

When there is an attempt to read past the end of a stream,
an `io.EOF` error is returned.
Some ways of reading from a stream check for this
so the error is never generated.
For example, a "scanner" can be used to
read the lines in a file one at a time.

```go
package main

import (
  "bufio"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  // Get an os.File which implements the io.Reader interface
  // by having a Read method.
  file, err := os.Open("haiku.txt")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer file.Close()

  scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file) // takes an io.Reader
  for scanner.Scan() { // returns true if another line was read
    fmt.Println(count, scanner.Text())
  }

  // Check for any errors from the calls to Scan and Text.
  if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

##### Writers

The `Writer` interface has a single method `Write`.
This writes a byte slice to an underlying data stream
and returns the number of bytes written or an error.
There are many implementations in the standard library
including ones for writing to strings, files, and network connections.

The package `io/ioutil` defines a `WriteString` function
that writes a string to a file.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io"
  "log"
  "os"
)

func check(err error) {
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func writeString(file *os.File, text string) {
  bytes, err := io.WriteString(file, text)
  check(err)
  fmt.Printf("wrote %v bytes\n", bytes)
}

func main() {
  file, err := os.Create("out-file.txt")
  check(err)
  defer file.Close()

  writeString(file, "first line\n")
  writeString(file, "second line\n")
}
```

The package `io/ioutil` defines a `WriteFile` function
that writes all the data to a file in a single call.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  // Convert a string to a byte slice.
  data := []byte("Line #1\nLine #2")
  // Make the file readable and writable by the owner
  // and readable by all others.
  mode := os.FileMode(0644)
  err := ioutil.WriteFile("new-file.txt", data, mode)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

To write data a little at time,
use the `os.File` `Write` method.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"
)

func check(err error) {
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

func writeLine(file *os.File, text string) {
  bytes, err := file.Write([]byte(text + "\n"))
  check(err)
  fmt.Printf("wrote %v bytes\n", bytes)
}

func main() {
  file, err := os.Create("out-file.txt")
  check(err)
  defer file.Close()

  writeLine(file, "Line #1")
  writeLine(file, "Line #2")
}
```

#### JSON

The `encoding/json` standard library package
supports marshaling and unmarshaling of JSON data.
Go arrays and slices are represented by JSON arrays.
Go structs and maps are represented by JSON objects.

The `encoding/xml` standard library package
provides similar functionality for XML.

To marshal data to JSON use the `json.Marshal` function.
This takes a Go value and returns a byte slice
that can be converted to a string with the `string` function.
Only exported struct fields are marshaled.
For example,

```go
import (
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

type Person struct {
  FirstName string
  LastName string
  Age int
  height int
}

func main() {
  p := Person{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann", height: 74}
  json1, err := json.Marshal(p)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(string(json1)) // {"FirstName":"Mark","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":0}
}
```

Some Go values cannot be marshaled to JSON. These include
maps with non-string keys, functions, and channels.
Pointers are marshaled as the values to which they point.
Cyclic data structures cannot be marshaled because
they cause `json.Marshal` to go into an infinite loop.

Here is an example of marshaling a slice of structs.

```go
people := []Person{
  Person{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann", Age: 57},
  Person{FirstName: "Tami", LastName: "Volkmann"},
}
json2, err := json.Marshal(people)
// skipping err check
fmt.Println(string(json2))
// [{"FirstName":"Mark","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":57},{"FirstName":"Tami","LastName":"Volkmann","Age":0}]
```

Each struct field definition can be followed by a "field tag"
which is a string containing metadata.
These provide information about how a field
should processed in a specific context.

A field tag with a "json" key specifies processing
that should be performed by the `encoding/json` package.
This includes specifying an alternate name for a field
to be used in the JSON representation, and an option to
omit the field if its value is the zero value for its type.
For example:

```go
type Person2 struct {
  FirstName string `json:"name"`
  LastName  string `json:"surname"`
  Age       int    `json:"age,omitempty"`
}

p2 := Person2{FirstName: "Mark", LastName: "Volkmann"}
json3, err := json.Marshal(p2)
// skipping err check
fmt.Println(string(json3)) // {"name":"Mark","surname":"Volkmann"}
```

To unmarshal data from JSON use the `json.Unmarshal` function.
The first argument is a byte slice representing a JSON string.
The second argument is a pointer to a
struct, map, slice, or array to be populated.
Only exported struct fields are populated.
For example,

```go
var p3 Person
err = json.Unmarshal(json1, &p3)
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", p3) // {FirstName:Mark LastName:Volkmann Age:0}
```

Properties present in the JSON, but absent in a target struct are ignored.
This is determined by case-insensitive name matching.
It allows unmarshaling a selected subset of the JSON data.
For example,

```go
type PersonSubset struct {
  LastName string
}
var pSubset PersonSubset
err = json.Unmarshal(json1, &pSubset)
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", pSubset) // {LastName:Volkmann}
```

A JSON object can be unmarshaled into a Go map.
When the JSON property values have a variety of types,
it is useful to use a map with string keys and values of type `interface{}`
which can hold any kind of value.
Unmarshaling from JSON types to Go types produces what would be expected
and includes mapping JSON numbers to Go float64 values.

This approach can also be used to unmarshal a JSON array
of arbitrary JSON objects. For example,

```go
type MyMap map[string]interface{}
mySlice := []MyMap{}
err = json.Unmarshal(json2, &mySlice) // see value for json2 above
// skipping err check
fmt.Printf("myMap = %+v\n", mySlice)
// [map[FirstName:Mark LastName:Volkmann Age:57] map[Age:0 FirstName:Tami LastName:Volkmann]]
```

The `encoding/json` package also provides the ability to
encode and decode streams of JSON data one object at a time.
This allows creation of JSON that is larger than will fit in memory.
It also allows processing JSON data as it is decoded
rather than waiting until the entire stream is decoded.

#### Linked Lists

The standard library package `container/list` defines the types
`List` and `Element` for creating and operating on doubly linked lists.

`Element` objects represent nodes in the `List`.
They are structs that have a `Value` field
with a type of `interface{}` which
allows them to hold a value of any type.

To create a new, empty doubly linked list, use the `List` method `New`.
For example, `myList := list.New()`.

To add an `Element` to a `List`, use the `List` methods
`PushFront`, `PushBack`, `InsertAfter`, and `InsertBefore`.
These take a value of any type and return
the `Element` object they add to the `List`.

To get the length of a `List`, use the `List` method `Len`.

To get the first or last `Element` in a `List`,
use the `List` method `Front` or `Back`.

To add a copy of all the `Element` objects in another `List` to a `List`,
use the `List` methods `PushFrontList` and `PushBackList`.

To move an `Element` object to another location within its `List`, use the
`List` methods `MoveToFront`, `MoveToBack`, `MoveAfter`, and `MoveBefore`.

To remove an `Element` from its `List`, use the `List` method `Remove`.

To remove all the `Element` objects from a `List`,
making it empty, use the `Init` method.

To get the `Element` that comes before or after a given `Element`,
use the `Element` method `Prev` or `Next`.

For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "container/list"
  "fmt"
)

type Team struct {
  Name   string
  Wins   int
  Losses int
}

func main() {
  // Create an empty, doubly-linked list.
  teams := list.New()

  // Add elements to the list.
  // Team records are from 11/24/2018.
  firstPlace := teams.PushFront(Team{"Chiefs", 9, 2})
  lastPlace := teams.PushBack(Team{"Raiders", 2, 8})
  teams.InsertBefore(Team{"Broncos", 4, 6}, lastPlace)
  teams.InsertAfter(Team{"Chargers", 7, 3}, firstPlace)

  for team := teams.Front(); team != nil; team = team.Next() {
    fmt.Println(team.Value.(Team).Name) // Chiefs, Chargers, Broncos, Raiders
  }
}
```

#### Logging

The standard library package `log` provides functions
that help with writing error messages to stderr.

By default, `log.Fatal(message)` outputs a line
containing the date, time, and message,
and exits with a status code of 1.

By default, `log.Fatalf(formatString, args)` is similar,
but uses a format string to specify the message string
that includes placeholders for the remaining arguments.

Including the date and time in log messages
is useful in long-running applications
like web servers.

A custom prefix can be added to all messages
produced by the `log` package
by calling `log.SetPrefix(prefix)`.

The date and time can be suppressed
in all messages produced by the `log` package
by calling `log.SetFlags(0)`.
This function takes an integer which is the result of or'ing
predefined constants that identify the desired parts of the prefix.

The constants are:

- `Ldate` - yyyy/mm/dd in local time zone
- `Ltime` - hh:mm:ss in local time zone
- `Lmicroseconds` - hh:mm:ss.microseconds
- `Llongfile` - full-file-path:line-number
- `Lshortfile` - file-name.file-extension:line-number
- `LUTC` - use UTC instead of local time zone for dates and times
- `LstdFlags` - same as `Ldate | Ltime`; the default flags value

`log.Panic(message)` outputs a line
containing the date, time, and message,
followed by a line containing "panic:" and the message again,
followed by a stack trace.
It exits the application with a status code of 2.

To write messages to stdout that include
a file name, line number, name of a variable, and its value,
write a function like the following and call it from other functions.

```go
func logValue(name string, value interface{}) {
  // Passing 1 to runtime.Caller causes it to get the
  // information from one level higher in the call stack.
  _, file, line, ok := runtime.Caller(1)
  if ok {
    fmt.Printf("%s:%d %s=%v\n", file, line, name, value)
  } else {
    fmt.Printf("%s=%v\n", name, value)
  }
}
```

#### OS Commands

The standard library package `os/exec` defines types with
methods that support executing operating system commands.
The four methods that do this are `Output`, `CombinedOutput`, `Run`, and `Start`.
All but `Start` block until the command finishes.

To use these methods, create a `Cmd` object by calling `cmd.Command`.
This takes a command name and its arguments as separate string arguments.
It returns a pointer to a `Cmd` object.
A `Cmd` object can only execute its command once.
To execute the same command again, create a new `Cmd` object.

The `Output` method returns a byte array
containing the output to stdout, and an error.
If the error is not `nil`, `error.Stderr` will be set to a byte slice
which can be turned into a string with `string(error.Stderr)`.

The `CombinedOutput` method returns a byte array
containing the combined output to stdout and stderr,
and an error.

The `Run` method returns an error.
Before calling this, optionally
assign an `io.Reader` to `cmd.Stdin` to supply an input stream,
assign an `io.Writer` to `cmd.Stdout` to supply an output stream, and
assign an `io.Writer` to `cmd.Stderr` to supply an error stream.

For example, all of the following approaches produce the same output:

```go
  cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-la")
  output, err := cmd.Output()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("Command =", string(output))

  cmd = exec.Command("ls", "-la")
  output, err = cmd.CombinedOutput()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("CombinedOutput =", string(output))

  cmd = exec.Command("ls", "-la")
  var stdout bytes.Buffer
  cmd.Stdout = &stdout
  err = cmd.Run()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("Run =", stdout.String())

  cmd = exec.Command("ls", "-la")
  var stdout2 bytes.Buffer
  cmd.Stdout = &stdout2
  err = cmd.Start()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  // Do something else here before using the `wait` method
  // to block until the command completes.
  err = cmd.Wait()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("Start =", stdout2.String())
```

#### Regular Expressions

The standard library package `regexp` defines functions
and the type `Regexp` for working with regular expressions.

The regular expression syntax supported by this package
is mostly the same as that supported by Perl.
For details on the syntax, see
<https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>.

The easiest way to determine if text matches a regular expression
is to use the functions `MatchString` and `Match`.
Both return a `bool` indicating whether there is a match.
These differ in how the text to be tested is supplied.
`MatchString` takes a `String` and `Match` takes a `byte` slice.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
  "regexp"
)

func main() {
  text := "FooBarBaz"
  matched, err := regexp.MatchString("Bar", text)
  fmt.Println(matched, err) // true nil
  matched, err = regexp.MatchString("^Foo", text)
  fmt.Println(matched, err) // true nil
  matched, err = regexp.MatchString("Baz$", text)
  fmt.Println(matched, err) // true nil
  matched, err = regexp.MatchString("bad[", text)
  fmt.Println(matched, err) // false error parsing regexp: missing closing ]

  // The file haiku.txt contains:
  // Out of memory.
  // We wish to hold the whole sky,
  // but we never will.
  bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile("haiku.txt")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  matched, err = regexp.Match("whole sky", bytes)
  fmt.Println(matched, err) // true nil
}
```

For regular expressions that will be used multiple times,
it is more efficient to create a Regexp object
so the regular expression is parsed only once.
The functions `Compile` and `CompilePOSIX`
take a string and return a pointer to a `Regexp` and an error.
A non-nil error is returned if the string
cannot be parsed as a regular expression.
The functions `MustCompile` and `MustCompilePOSIX`
are similar, but panic instead of returning an error.

The `POSIX` variants restricts the regular expression syntax
and use "leftmost-longest" matching. For details, see
<https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#CompilePOSIX>.

For example:

```go
  // Panics if the regular expression cannot be parsed.
  // Note how backslashes for character classes
  // must be escaped with a second backslash.
  bingoRE := regexp.MustCompile("^[BINGO]\\d{1,2}$")

  // Escaping backslashes is not needed in raw string literals
  // (delimited by back ticks).  For example,
  //bingoRE := regexp.MustCompile(`^[BINGO]\d{1,2}$`)

  // Determine whether a strings matches this regular expression.
  callout := "G57"
  matched := bingoRE.MatchString(callout)
  fmt.Println(matched) // true
```

To capture matches of specific portions of a regular expression,
surround them with parentheses to define "capture groups".
The method `FindStringSubmatch` returns a slice containing
the full match and the match for each of the capture groups.
If the string does not match the regular expression,
an empty slice is returned.
For example, the following regular expression
defines capture groups to capture the letter and number
of a Bingo call.

```go
  bingoRE := regexp.MustCompile("^([BINGO])(\\d{1,2})$")
  matches := bingoRE.FindStringSubmatch("G57")
  fmt.Printf("matches = %v\n", matches) // matches = [G57 G 57]
```

To split a string on a regular expression delimiter,
using the `Regexp` `Split method`. For example:

```go
  text := "ab1c23def456g"
  digitsRE := regexp.MustCompile("\\d+") // matches one or more digits
  parts := digitsRE.Split(text, -1) // -1 to return all parts
  fmt.Printf("parts = %v\n", parts) // parts = [ab c def g]
```

We have just scratched the surface of the `regexp` package.
There are many more methods on the `Regexp` type.

#### Sorting

The standard library package `sort` defines functions and types
that help with sorting slices and custom collections.

To sort slices of primitive values, use the functions
`Ints`, `Float64s`, and `Strings`. For example:

```go
numbers := []int{7, 3, 9, 1}
sort.Ints(numbers)
fmt.Printf("%v\n", numbers) // [1 3 7 9]
```

To determine if a slice of primitive values is already sorted,
use the functions `IntsAreSorted`, `Float64sAreSorted`, and `StringsAreSorted`.

To sort a slice of non-primitive values,
pass the slice and a function for comparing elements
to the `Slice` function. For example:

```go
package main

type Person struct {
  Name string
  Occupation string
}

func main() {
  people := []Person{}
  people = append(people, Person{"Mark", "software engineer"})
  people = append(people, Person{"Tami", "vet receptionist"})
  people = append(people, Person{"Amanda", "nurse"})
  people = append(people, Person{"Jeremy", "IT manager"})

  // This function determines whether
  // the slice element at index1 should come before
  // the slice element at index2 in the sort order.
  belongsBefore := func(index1, index2 int) bool {
    return people[index1].Name < people[index2].Name
  }
  sort.Slice(people, belongsBefore)
  for _, person := range people {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", person)
  }
  // Output is:
  // {Amanda nurse}
  // {Jeremy IT manager}
  // {Mark software engineer}
  // {Tami vet receptionist}
}
```

To sort a custom collection, rather than a slice,
implement the methods in the `sort.Interface` interface
for the custom collection type.
These methods include `Len`, `Less`, and `Swap`.
The `Len` method returns the number of elements in the collection.
The `Less` method takes two indexes and returns a `bool`
that indicates whether the element at the first index
comes before the element at the second index in sort order.
The `Swap` method takes two indexes and modifies the collection
so the elements at those indexes are swapped.
Finally, call the `sort.Sort` function to sort the collection.

The `sort.Sort` function performs an unstable sort.
This means that two elements with the same "sort key"
may be in a different order after the sort.
For a stable sort, use `sort.Stable` instead.

For example, this approach can be used to sort a linked list.
The following code sorts the list of `Team` elements
created in the "Doubly Linked List" section above.

```go
package main

import (
  "container/list"
  "fmt"
  "sort"
)

// ListAt returns a pointer to the List Element at a given index.
// This is not an efficient operation for a linked list.
func ListAt(l *list.List, index int) *list.Element {
  len := l.Len()
  if index >= len {
    return nil
  }

  element := l.Front()
  for i := 1; i < index; i++ {
    element = element.Next()
  }
  return element
}

// ListPrint prints the elements of a linked list.
func ListPrint(l *list.List) {
  for element := l.Front(); element != nil; element = element.Next() {
    fmt.Println(element.Value)
  }
}

// Team describes a sports team.
type Team struct {
  Name   string
  Wins   int
  Losses int
}

// ByName is used to sort a linked list of Team object by team name.
type ByName struct {
  teams *list.List
}

// Len returns the length of the linked list of Teams.
func (b ByName) Len() int {
  return b.teams.Len()
}

// Less determines if the Team at one index belongs
// before the Team at another index in the sort order.
func (b ByName) Less(i, j int) bool {
  teams := b.teams
  team1 := ListAt(teams, i).Value.(Team)
  team2 := ListAt(teams, j).Value.(Team)
  return team1.Name < team2.Name
}

// Swap swaps the Teams at the given indexes.
func (b ByName) Swap(i, j int) {
  if i > j {
    i, j = j, i // swap indexes so i < j
  }

  teams := b.teams
  el1 := ListAt(teams, i)
  el2 := ListAt(teams, j)
  el2Next := el2.Next()

  teams.MoveAfter(el2, el1)

  if el2Next == nil {
    teams.MoveToBack(el1)
  } else {
    teams.MoveBefore(el1, el2Next)
  }
}

func main() {
  // Create an empty, doubly-linked list.
  teams := list.New()

  // Add Teams to the list.
  firstPlace := teams.PushFront(Team{"Chiefs", 9, 2})
  lastPlace := teams.PushBack(Team{"Raiders", 2, 8})
  teams.InsertBefore(Team{"Broncos", 4, 6}, lastPlace)
  teams.InsertAfter(Team{"Chargers", 7, 3}, firstPlace)

  sort.Sort(ByName{teams})
  ListPrint(teams)
  // Output is:
  // {Broncos 4 6}
  // {Chargers 7 3}
  // {Chiefs 9 2}
  // {Raiders 2 8}
}
```

In addition to sorting, the `sort` package
provides functions for searching slices.
`SearchInts`, `SearchFloat64s`, and `SearchStrings`
search an already sorted slice of their type for
an element with a given value and return its index.

#### Strings

The standard library package `strings`
provides functions for operating on strings.
The code below demonstrates many of them.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "strings"
)

func main() {
  text := "abcdef"
  fmt.Println(strings.Contains(text, "bc")) // true
  fmt.Println(strings.HasPrefix(text, "ab")) // true
  fmt.Println(strings.HasSuffix(text, "ef")) // true
  fmt.Println(strings.Index(text, "cd")) // 2

  names := []string{"Mark", "Tami", "Amanda", "Jeremy"}
  joined := strings.Join(names, ", ")
  fmt.Printf("%+v\n", joined) // Mark, Tami, Amanda, Jeremy

  fmt.Println(strings.Repeat(text, 2)) // abcdefabcdef
  fmt.Println(strings.Split(text, "cd")) // [ab ef]
  fmt.Println(strings.ToUpper(text)) // ABCDEF
  fmt.Println(strings.Trim("  foo bar  ", " ")) // "foo bar"
  // Also see TrimLeft and TrimRight.

  // The Builder type supports efficiently building strings.
  var b strings.Builder
  b.WriteString("Foo")
  b.WriteString("Bar")
  b.WriteString("Baz")
  // Other Write methods on Builder include:
  // Write to write a byte slice
  // WriteByte to write a single byte
  // WriteRune to write a single rune
  fmt.Println(b.String()) // FooBarBaz

  sentence := "Mark goes to the park."
  fmt.Println(strings.Replace(sentence, "ar", "il", -1)) // Milk goes to the pilk.

  // The Replacer type provides a more powerful alternative to strings.Replace.
  // This demonstrates HTML entity escaping.
  // Create a Replace object with pairs of old/new strings.
  r := strings.NewReplacer("&", "&amp;", "'", "&apos;", "\"", "&quot;", "<", "&lt;", ">", "&gt;")
  // Call the Replace method once for each string to be processed.
  fmt.Println(r.Replace("It's \"true\" that 5 is '>' 4."))
  // It&apos;s &quot;true&quot; that 5 is &apos;&gt;&apos; 4.
}
```

#### Unicode

The standard library package `unicode` defines
many constants, variables, functions, and types
for testing and converting `rune` values.

Many of the constants define ranges of Unicode characters
used in specific written languages.

Many of the functions take a `rune` and return a `bool`
indicating whether the `rune` is a member of
a particular category of Unicode characters.
These include `IsDigit`, `IsLetter`, `IsLower`, `IsUpper`,
and `IsSpace`.

`IsSpace` determines whether a `rune` represents a whitespace character.
These include the characters space, tab, newline, carriage return,
and the less commonly used characters
formfeed, non-breaking space (NBSP), vertical tab, and next line (NEL).

The functions `ToLower` and `ToUpper`
take a `rune` and return another `rune`.
