## Installing in Mac OS X
```
brew update
brew install rabbitmq
```

## Starting Server
```
./usr/local/sbin/rabbitmq-server
```

Consider adding /usr/local/sbin to the PATH environment variable.

## Node Client 

### Option #1: node-amqp
node-amqp at https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp

Ryan Dahl and James Carr have contributed to this.
```
npm install amqp
```

An issue with this client module is that async functions that
take a callback do not pass an error description to the callback
as the first argument.  That means flow control libraries such as
async cannot be used with them unless a wrapping layer is created
around those functions that fixes this.  It wouldn't be too
difficult to do that.

### Option #2: STOMP
This can communicate with ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ and HornetQ.
It is a very simple API, perhaps too simple.
It may not be possible to configure all the options
of a particular implementation with this API.

## AMQP
RabbitMQ uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) which is "an
open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware".
It is defines both an API and a wire-level protocol.

The working group that defines the AMQP standard is composed of
representatives from 23 companies, primarily in the financial industry.

Version 1.0 of the AMQP standard was released on 10/30/11.
The standard is now managed by OASIS.

AMQP implementations are interoperable.  Other message servers that
implement AMQP include Apache Qpid, JORAM and StormMQ.

For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP

One somewhat troubling statement from this Wikipedia article is:
"The 1.0 specification changes the AMQP model illustrated above
by removing the concepts of exchanges and bindings,
and replacing these with queues and links."
So some of what is described below
only applies to the 0-9-1 version of the spec.
James Carr feels that 1.0 adoption won't happen anytime soon
because it is a radical change.  That in itself is not comforting.

Open specifications that compete with AMQP include Stomp and XMPP.
Vendor-specific specifications that compete with AMQP include
Amazon Simple Queue Service, IBM WebSphere MQ, Microsoft Message Queuing,
Java Message Service (JMS) and OpenWire (used by ActiveMQ).

A close competitor of RabbitMQ, 0MQ (a.k.a. ZeroMQ), was developed by iMatrix.
The CEO of iMatrix, Pieter Hintjens was the original designer of AMQP.
iMatrix no longer participates in the AMQP working group.
They claim that 0MQ is simpler and faster than AMQP implementations.

There is a Node.js binding for 0MQ at
https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node.
visionmedia has contributed to this.

## Component Overview
Message brokers (a.k.a. servers) manage server-side components
and support user authentication.
Some AMQP implementations, including RabbitMQ, support clustered servers.
See http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html.

Connections connect to a server and are used to
create and access exchanges and queues.

Messages have a body and optional headers.

Producers send messages to exchanges by publishing them,
along with a routing key.

Exchanges route messages to queues based on the routing key of the messages.

Consumers subscribe to queues in order to receive messages.

Bindings bind a queue to an exchange and specify a binding key
that is used to determine which messages should be routed to the queue.

Clients cannot request lists of exchanges and queues that have been
created in a server.  They must know their names in order to use them.

## Connections
Connections are created by calling <code>amqp.createConnection()</code>.
This immediately returns a reference to the new connection,
but it isn't ready for use until it emits a "ready" event.

Connections emit "close", "error" and "ready" events.
One use of listening for error events is to attempt to
reestablish a connection every second or so until successful.
The Connection class has a reconnect method.

The createConnection function takes an options object
which can include the following properties:
host, port, login, password and vhost.
Host and port specify where the server is running/listening.
To require a login and password, start the server with ???

vhost specifies the virtual host on which the connection will be created.
The main use of this seems to be to restrict user capabilities.
Users can be restricted to only obtain connections to specific virtual hosts.

Connection objects have the properties "exchanges" and "queues"
that hold objects that store references to those, keyed by name.
Connection objects have the property "channels" that holds an array.
The first element in the array refers to the connection object itself.
The remaining elements are the Queue objects that have been accessed or created
from this Connection object using the conn.queue method.

Connection objects only know about exchanges and queues that are
explicitly created or looked up from the connection.
It doesn't automatically discover all the exchanges and queues
known to the server.

## Channels
The Exchange and Queue classes inherits from the Channel class.
The Channel class inherits from EventEmitter.
Channel objects have a "channel" property that is an integer that
uniquely identifies Exchange and Queue objects associated with a Connection.

## Exchanges
There are three types of exchanges: fanout, direct and topic.

A fanout exchange routes all messages to all queues bound to the exchange.

A direct exchange routes messages to only the queue whose
binding key (specified when binding the queue to an exchange)
exactly matches the message routing key (specified when the message is published).

A topic exchange routes messages to each queues bound to the exchange
whose binding key matches the message routing key.
For example, a message with the routing key "foo.bar" would be
routed to the queues with binding keys "foo.#" and "#.bar".
There are two wildcard characters that can be used in binding keys.
"#" can be replaced by zero or more words.
"*" can be replaced by exactly one word.
In this context, "words" are separated by periods.

An exchange can be bound to the same queue more than once with different
binding keys.  This way the messages that are routed to a given queue
do not all have to have the similar routing keys, regardless of whether
a direct or topic exchange is being used.

Multiple exchanges can be bound to the same queue.

Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same queue.
Each message will only be delivered to one of the consumers.
This can be used to partition work.
For a demo of this, follow these steps:

1. start RabbitMQ server
2. in another window, node topicConsumer.js
3. in another window, node topicConsumer.js
4. in anoter window, node topicProducer.js
5. note that some messages went to the first consumer
   and the others went to the second consumer

Multiple consumers can use separate queues that have identical bindings
so messages that match the bindings are delivered to each consumer.

Messages with a routing key that doesn't match any binding key
for the exchange are discarded.  The next section describes
how this can be detected.

The type of an exchange cannot be changed after it is created.
To use an exchange with the same name as an existing one,
but with a different type, destroy the existing exchange either
by retrieving it with conn.exchange() and calling destroy on it
or destroying it from the web management UI (described later).

Exchanges emit "basic-return", "close", "error" and "open" events.
A use for the first of these is described in the next section.
The others do not seem useful.
The conn.exchange method passes the exchange to its callback
and that can be used immediately, so the open event isn't needed.

## Publishing Messages
There are two ways to publish messages.
```
conn.publish(queueName, message);
exchange.publish(routingKey, message, options);
```

When a message is published directly to a queue, it uses the default exchange
which can be specified when the connection to the server is created.
Default exchanges are always "direct" exchanges.

When a message is published to an exchange, the queues that receive it
are determined by the exchange type and the message routing key.

If a message is published to an exchange and the routing key doesn't
match the binding key of any queue, the message will be dropped.
To be notified of this, set the "mandatory" property to true in the
publish options and listen for "basic-return" events on the exchange
as follows:
```
var NO_ROUTE = 312;
exchange.on('basic-return', function (reply) {
  if (reply.replyCode === NO_ROUTE) {
    console.log('exchange "' + reply.exchange +
      '" failed to route message with key "' + reply.routingKey +
      '" to a queue');
  }
});
```

## Queues
Queues are created and/or retrieved using conn.queue();
Queues emit "close", "data", "error", "message" events.
None of these seems very useful.
The queue.subscribe method passes messages to its callback
when they arrive, so the data and message events aren't needed.

## Subscribing to Queues
```
queue.subscribe(function (msg, headers, deliveryInfo) { ... });
```
The message object passed to the subscribe callback
has the properties "data" and "contentType".
The value of the "data" property is a Buffer.
Call toString on the Buffer to get text values.
The deliveryInfo object contains the following properties:

* contentType - MIME type of the message
* queue - name of the queue from which the message came
* deliveryTag - may be a legacy property
* redelivered - false if delivered on first try; true otherwise
* exchange - name of the exchange to which the queue is bound
* routingKey - routing key specified when the message was published
* consumerTag - needed to unsubscribe from the queue

## Durability and autoDelete
To publish messages that survive server restarts,
make exchanges and queues durable by setting their
"durable" option to true.

When this is done it is likely also desirable to
set their "autoDelete" option to false.
Exchanges that have autoDelete set to true
are deleted if no queues are bound to them.
Queues that have autoDelete set to true
are deleted if they have no subscribers.

For a demo of this, follow these steps:

1. start RabbitMQ server
2. node topicProducer.js
3. ctrl-c to stop step 2
4. ctrl-c to stop the RabbitMQ server started in step 1
5. restart RabbitMQ server
6. node topicConsumer.js
7. note that the messages published in step 2 are received in step 6!

## Acknowledgement
To acknowledge receipt of a message in a subscriber, ?
Is this done automatically?

To guarantee that some consumer has received a given message, ?

## Browser Clients
RabbitMQ cannot be used directly in browser JavaScript code.
The RabbitMQ code can run in a web server process.
Browser code can communicate with a web server process in many ways.
Socket.IO is a recommended approach.
For a demo of this, see sandboxes/mvolkmann/rabbitmq/web-demo.
Its README.md file provides instructions on running it.
Also see Dropbox/GEP/RabbitMQ.graffle which describes this architecture.

## Some Use Cases
1. batch processing
2. image uploading
3. distributed logging

## Programming Languages
The RabbitMQ server is implemented in Erlang.
There is client support for many programming languages including:
* C/C++
* Clojure
* Erlang
* Haskell
* Java
* JavaScript (Node.js)
* Lisp
* .NET (C#, VB, ...)
* Ocaml
* Perl
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* Scala

## Platforms
RabbitMQ is supported on these platforms:
* Android
* Amazon EC2
* Linux
* OpenVMS
* Mac OS X
* Solaris
* Windows

## Web Management UI
To enable, enter "/usr/local/sbin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management".
Restart the server and browse http://localhost:55672/mgmt/

The "Exchanges" tab lists the exchanges.
Select one to see details about it.
From this screen one can:
* see counts of incoming and outgoing messages that were published and confirmed
* see, create and delete bindings to queues
* publish messages
* delete an exchange

The "Users" tab lists the registered users.
From this screen one can:
* see all registered users
* add a user
* set permissions for a user
* change a user password
* delete a user

For more detail on the web management UI,
see http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html.

## Other Options
Other messaging software that could be used in place of RabbitMQ includes:
* ActiveMQ - seems very Java-centric, supporting JMS, JCA and Spring
* Redis - an in-memory datastore that also has pub/sub capabilities
* Kue - backed by Redis
* ZeroMQ - also spelled "0MQ"
  * too low-level
  * more of a transport protocol
  * "no services or daemons to start, unless you build them yourself. ØMQ is a library."
