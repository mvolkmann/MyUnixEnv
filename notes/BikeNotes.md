# Bike Notes

## Di2 electronic shifting

### Testing

- Hold down any shifter button (left or right) and look for a light on the junction box.
- If you see a green light for about two seconds, you have a fully charged battery.
- If a green light flashes five times, the battery is at about 50 per cent.
- A solid red light means about 25 per cent of the battery’s charge left.
- A flashing red means that it’s almost dead.
- Charge as soon as you see a flashing red light.

### Adjustment Mode

A common mistake made when checking battery life is to hold down the wrong button.
If you press and hold the button on the junction box you will see a solid red light.
You’ve just put the system in adjustment mode.
Your shifter will now behave like the barrel adjuster on a mechanical rear derailleur.
This is the mode you want to be in if you want to tweak the shifting.
If you hit the junction-box button by mistake,
press and hold it again until the red light disappears.

If you’ve neglected your battery and it gets critically low during a ride,
the front derailleur will stop working first.
You’ll still have the rear derailleur to get you home.

### Crash Protection Mode

If you have a tumble and your Di2 bike doesn’t shift anymore,
your system has gone into crash-protection mode.
This mode prevents further damage if something is broken or off.
For example, the system will keep the derailleur from shifting
into the rear wheel if the hanger is severely bent.
