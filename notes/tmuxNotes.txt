tmux Notes

To install
- brew install tmux
- to see version installed
  * tmux -V

Mac keys
- meta key is ctrl-option
- to change Caps Lock key to function as Control key
  * System Preferences ... Keyboard ... Modifier Keys
  * set Caps Lock key to Control

To allow 256 colors on a Mac
- must use iTerm2 instead of Terminal app
- iTerm ... Preferences ... Profiles ... Terminal
  * set "Report Terminal Type" to "xterm-256color"
- Do you have to start tmux with "tmux -2" to get 256 colors?

To configure
- edit ~/.tmux.conf
  * can also create /etc/tmux.conf
    - shared by users that do not have ~/.tmux.conf
- comments
  * everything from # to end of a line
- to change prefix keystroke (ex. ctrl-a)
  * add this line to ~/.tmux.conf: set -g prefix C-a
- to bind a key to a command
  * bind {key} {command}
  * ex. bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
- to unbind a key so it can be assigned differently later
  * unbind {key}
- to list all key bindings
  * prefix ?
  * press return when finished viewing
- to configure status bar
  * set -g status-left-length 30
  * set -g status-left "session #S window #I pane #P -"
    - default is "[#S]"
    - shows current session, window and pane numbers
    - includes some arbitrary text
  * for parts of date and time, use strftime tokens
    - see http://www.foragoodstrftime.com
  * set -g status-right-length 45
  * set -g status-right "#h %a %m/%d/%y"
    - shows host name, day of week abbrev., month abbrev., day and 2-digit year
  * to include result of a shell command
    - use $(shell-command) in format string
  * to change font color in status bar
    * add #[fg={color}] to a format string
    * can use 16 color names and colour0 to colour255
      - black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
  * set -g status-interval 60
    - updates every minute instead of default of 15 seconds
  * window list
    - displayed after status-left by default
    - to center
      * set -g status-justify centre
      * lists each window by displaying index:name (#I:#W)
    - to have window in list get blue background when activity occurs in it
      * setw -g monitor-activity on
      * set -g visual-activity on
- to load configuration changes in a running tmux session
  * prefix : source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  * or prefix r with key binding above

Sessions
- consider creating a separate session from each group of related activities
  * perhaps one for each project
- to start a new session: $ tmux new -s {name} [{command}](-s for session)
  * if a command is specified, it is run in the window created
- to detach from a session, leaving it running: prefix d
- to list existing sessions
  * from command-line: $ tmux ls
  * from a session: prefix s
- to use an existing session: $ tmux attach -t {name} (-t for target-session)
- to kill a session: $ tmux kill-session -t {name} (-t for target-session)
- to switch to a different session
  * for previous: prefix (
  * for next: prefix )

Windows
- to open a new window: prefix c
- to list current windows: prefix w
- to rename a window: prefix ,
- to switch to an existing window by number: prefix {0..9}
- to switch to a different window
  * for previous: prefix p
  * for next: prefix n
- to close current window: prefix &
- to move current window to a different session
  * prefix .
  * enter other session name

Panes
- to open a new pane
  * horizontally: prefix " (customized to prefix -)
  * vertically: prefix % (customized to prefix |)
- to cycle through panes in current window: prefix o
- to switch to different pane: prefix o (cycles) or prefix {arrow-key}
- to change layout of panes: prefix esc {0-5}
- to cycle through layouts: prefix space
- to rotate panes in current window
  * clockwise: prefix ctrl-o
  * counter-clockwise: prefix ctrl-option-o
- to swap the current pane
  * with the previous one: prefix {
  * with the next one: prefix }
  * with a given pane: prefix : swap-pane -s {pane-index}
- to briefly display pane numbers in each pane: prefix q
- to move to a numbered pane: ? 
- to close a pane: enter "exit" or press prefix x
- to move current pane to new window: prefix !
- to move current pane to another window
  * prefix : join-pane -t {session-name}:{target-window}.{target-pane}
  * pane is added after target pane
  * omit {session-name}: for current session (typical)
  * .{target-pane} must be specified
    - otherwise it treats the -t value
      as a pane index within the current window (bad!)
- to move a given pane to the current window
  * prefix : join-pane -s {session-name}:{source-window}.{source-pane}
  * omit {session-name}: for current session (typical)
  * omit .{source-pane} if only one pane in source window
  * pane is added after pane with focus

Help
- to show: prefix ?
- to exit: q

Command Mode
- to enter: prefix :
- can use tab completion when entering command name
- can use up and down arrows to recall previous commands

Scripting tmux environments
- three approaches
  * project-specific shell scripts
    - see example in programming/Tools/tmux/mytmux
  * project-specific tmux config files
    * in config file, use shared config file from home directory with
      source-file ~/.tmux.conf
    * in config file, start new session with
      new-session -s {session-name} -n {window-name} -d
    * start tmux with "tmux -f {file-path} attach
  * tmuxinator - a Ruby app that uses YAML

Output buffers
- copy mode
  * to enter, prefix [
  * to exit, press return
- to move around
  * enter copy mode
  * use Vim keys or arrow keys to navigate
- to copy text
  * enter copy mode
  * move to start
  * press spacebar
  * move to end
  * press return
- to copy all visible text in current pane
  * prefix : capture-pane
- each copy creates a new paste buffer on a stack
  * it seems the stack just grows forever
  * pasting from it doesn't remove a buffer
- to see list of paste buffers
  * prefix : list-buffers
  * press return when finished viewing
- to see content of top paste buffer
  * prefix : show-buffer
- to save content of top paste buffer to a file
  * prefix : save-buffer {file-path}
- to paste text from top paste buffer
  * prefix ]
- to paste test from a specific paste buffer
  * prefix = or prefix : choose-buffer
  * move cursor to one of the buffers and press return
  * press q to exit without choosing a buffer

Options
- to see list of all options
  * prefix : show-options -g
