VimL Notes

Intro
- The programming language used to implemenent Vim plugins
  is called "Vim script", "Vimscript", and "VimL".
  * Having multiple names can make it challenging to
    google for help.
  * It may be helpful to include both "VimL" and "Vimscript" in searches.
  * These notes refer to is as VimL.
- VimL is neither good nor bad, just different than
  the other programming languages you know.
- One of the best sources of information is the
  free, online book "Learn Vimscript the Hard Way"
  at http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/.
- Builtin help inside Vim is available by entering :help {topic}.
- To get started, create a file named hello.vim.
- Edit this file in Vim and enter the following:
  echo 'Hello, World!'
- To load and execute VimL code in the current buffer,
  enter :source %
- This will display "Hello, World!" in the message area
  below the status line.
- echomsg is similar to echo, but also saves in message history.
- To see the last n messages in message history,
  press :messages or :mes

Style
- see "Google Vimscript Style Guide" at
  https://google.github.io/styleguide/vimscriptguide.xml
- use vint for linting
  * see https://github.com/Kuniwak/vint
  * install with "pip install vim-vint"
  * configure by creating a .vintrc.yaml file in home directory
  * ALE plugin will run vint on .vim files if it is installed
  * can use to lint .vimrc and plugin .vim files

Miscellaneous
- many VimL commands come from Ex
- syntastic plugin has builtin vimlint support
- to load code in current buffer, source %
- long lines can be split into multiple lines by
  preceding each continuation line with \
- statements are NOT terminated with semicolons
- blocks of code are NOT delimited by curly braces
- most keywords and commands can be abbreviated
  to the shortest, non-ambiguous form
  * ex. function can be shorted to fun
    and endfunction can be shorted to endf
- to get help on a given builtin function,
  :help fn-name()

Variables
- names include letters, digits, and _; cannot start with a digit
- create and modify with
  let {name} = {value}
- destroy with
  unlet {name}
- test for existence with
  if exists('name')
  * note the quotes!
- prefixes affect scope
  none - if inside a function, local to it; otherwise global
  a: - current function argument
  b: - current buffer
  g: - global
  l: - function
  s: - :source'ed Vim script
  t: - current tab page
  v: - global; predefined by Vim
  w: - current window
  &  - option variables
       * set with :set {name} = {value}
  @ - for registers
- to iterate over all the variables in a given scope,
  for example, buffer scope:
  for key in keys(b:)
    echo b:[key]
  endfor

Autocommands
- execute specified commands when a given event occurs in specific files
- syntax: autocmd {event} {file-pattern} {commands}
  * separate multiple commands with |
  * define on multiple lines using \ continuation line prefix
- autocommand groups
  - all autocommands belong to an autocommand group
    * either the default group of the most recently specified group
  - to start a new group, augroup {name}
    * immediately after this, typically want to
      clear all autocommands previously added to this group
      with autocmd!
    * prevents collisions (duplicate definitions)
      if the source file is reloaded
  - to return to the default autocommand group,
    augroup END
    * the name "END" refers to the default group

Buffers
- to append text after a given line in current buffer,
  call append(line-number, text)
  * using 0 for line-number prepends
- to append a List of text lines after a given line in current buffer,
  call append(line-number, list)
- to get a specific line number
  * first visible line - line('w0')
  * last visible line - line('w$')
  * current line - line('.')
  * last line in buffer - line('$')
  * first line selected in visual mode - line('v')
- to test whether a buffer exists, bufexists(buf-name)
- to get the buffer number that contains a given file, bufnr(file-name)
- to get the window number where a buffer is displayed,
  bufwinnr(buf-name)
  * returns -1 if not current displayed in a window
- to open a new split window and display a given buffer number,
  execute 'sbuffer ' . buf-num
- to get the line at a given index within the current buffer,
  getline(line-num)
- to get the character under the cursor,
  let char = getline('.')[col('.') - 1]
  * only works with single-byte characters
  * for multi-byte, yank into a register (ex. z)
    execute 'normal "zyl'
    let char = getreg('z')

Builtin Functions
- for a list of all builtin functions, :help function-list
- for lists of functions in specific groups, use the help commands below
- :help string-functions
- :help list-functions
- :help dict-functions
- :help float-functions
- :help bitwise-functions
- :help var-functions
- :help cursor-functions or :help mark-functions
- :help text-functions
- :help file-functions or :help system-functions
- :help date-functions or :help time-functions
- :help buffer-functions or :help window-functions or :help arg-functions
- :help command-line-functions
- :help quickfix-functions
- :help completion-functions
- :help folding-functions
- :help syntax-functions or :help highlighting-functions

- :help history-functions
- :help interactive-functions
- :help gui-functions
- :help server-functions
- :help window-size-functions
- :help mapping-functions
- :help various-functions
- one way to move the cursor: cursor(line, column)
  * also see getpos() which returns a list
- to prompt the user, echo confirm("is this ok?", "&Yes\n&No")
  * to make "No" the default choice,
    echo confirm("is this ok?", "&Yes\n&No\n&Don't know", 2)

Comments
- single-line comments begin with "
  * can't have another " on the same line
    because that would be a string literal
- no multi-line comment delimiters

Debugging
- to load a script being edited, press <leader>sb (,sb)
  for "source buffer"
- to bail out of code early for debugging, insert "return"
- the equivalent of JavaScript console.log('foo =', foo)
  is echomsg('foo = ' . foo)
- to output the content of a List
  for item in list
    echomsg(item)
  endfor

Echo
- echo {string} outputs a message in Vim's message area
- echomsg {string} does the same AND saves it in message history
- to convert a non-String value to a String, string(value)
- to see messages in history, :messages
- to clear message history, ???

Ex commands
- to execute one, execute {ex-string}
- to execute a string of normal-mode commands, execute "normal! {cmds}"
  * the ! causes default versions of commands to be executed,
    in case the user has remapped them

File Type Detection
- determined by .vim files in .vim/ftdetect
- to detect via file extension
  * example line to define "foo" file type
    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.foo set filetype=foo
- to detect via file content
  * ex. HTML
  if getline(1) =~ '\<html\>'
    set filetype=html
  endif
- to see the file type of the current buffer
  :set filetype?
- to set a buffer so it isn't associated with a file
  and doesn't need to be saved
  :set buftype=nofile
  * useful for buffers that a populated by plugins for display-only purposes

Flow control and loops
- if condition
    ...
  elseif condition
    ...
  else
    ...
  endif
  - condition is NOT surrounded by parens
  - strings that start with digits are coerced to a number
  - strings that do not start with digits are coerced to zero
  - zero is false; all other number values are true
  - to test if a variable is set, if exists('variableName')
- ternary expression
  condition ? true-value : false-value
- while condition
    ...
  endwhile
- for variable in someList
    ...
  endfor
- there is no loop like for i = 0; i < 10; i++

Functions
- has many builtin functions and more can be defined
- to define
  * function! Name()
    endfunction
  * ! lets it override previously defined functions with same name
  * the name must start uppercase
  * to return a value, "return value"
- to call
  * call Name(args)
    - the "call" keyword is not needed when function call is part of an expression
  * can call from command mode (:)
  * another option is to use the call function
    - call(Name, argList)
    - argList can be a literal list
- to refer to a named parameter inside a function,
  prefix name with "a:" to indicate argument scope
- to allow optional arguments, specify ... as last parameter
  * inside a function,
    all arguments are in a List accessed with a:index and
    optional arguments are in a List accessed with a:000[index]
  * List indexes are zero-based

Plugins
- a plugin is defined by files in subdirectories of .vim
  * autoload directory
    - holds files that are loaded on demand
    - provides a way to "namespace" functions
      * if the file autoload/foo.vim defines a foo#bar function,
        call it with
        call foo#bar(args)
      * if the file autoload/foo/bar.vim defines a foo#bar#baz function,
        call it with
        call foo#bar#baz(args)
    - a file isn't loaded until one of its functions is called
      * important for large plugins to reduce
        Vim startup time and memory used initially
  * doc
    - holds plugin documentation files
  * ftdetect
    - holds files that detect the type of a file being edited
  * ftplugin
    - holds files used to process files with a specific type
  * plugin
    - holds plugin files that are loaded when Vim is started
  * syntax
    - holds files that identify syntax elements in files with a specific type
    - used for syntax highlighting
- a plugin doesn't have to have a file in each of these directories
- to install a plugin
  * place files in the appropriate subdirectories of .vim
    or use a plugin manager like Pathogen or Vundle
- runtimepath option holds a list of directories Vim searches for plugin files
  * by default, only contains .vim
  * can add more
    - set runtimepath+=directory
    - restart Vim for change to take effect
  * Pathogen modifies this to include directories under .vim/bundle

Regular Expressions
- pass pattern as a string; ex. '/^foo$/'
- test whether a string matches with match(text, pattern)
  * returns index of match or -1 if it doesn't match

Syntax Highlighting
- defined by files in .vim/syntax directory
- defined using "syntax" and "highlight" commands
  * syntax command
    - identifies text that should be associated with a specific syntax group
    - several styles of identifying text are supported
      * in the following examples, JavaScriptKeyword and JavaScriptComment
        are syntax groups
      * keyword - specified by name
        - ex. syntax keyword JavaScriptKeyword yield
      * match - specified by a regex
        - ex. syntax match JavaScriptComment singleLineComment /\/\/.*/
      * region - specified by starting and ending regexes
        - ex. syntax region JavaScriptComment multiLineComment start=/\/\*/ end=/\*\//
          * can also specify text to skip with skip=/pattern/
    - concealing matched text
      * use syntax "conceal" argument to hide matching text
      * use syntax "concealends" argument to hide the start and end text of a region
      * must set conceallevel and concealcursor options
      * conceallevel
        - conceallevel=0 means show
        - conceallevel=1 means display replacement character in its place
          * defaults to space; change with "listchars conceal:c" where c is the replacement character
          * to see current replacement characters, :syn-cchar
        - conceallevel=2 means hide unless a replacement character was specified
          * to see current replacement characters, :syn-cchar
        - conceallevel=3 means hide
        - ex. setlocal conceallevel=3
      * concealcursor
        - concealcursor sets the modes in which the cursor line text can be concealed
          * n for normal
          * i for insert
          * v for visual (applies to all lines in visual area)
          * c for command
        - setting is local to the current window
        - ex. setlocal concealcursor=nivc
  * highlight command
    - map a syntax group to highlighting to be applied
    - to see all current highlight mappings
      * :highlight
    - can specify highlighting for three types of terminals
      * term - terminal Vim with no color support
      * cterm - terminal Vim with color support
      * gui - for GUI/non-terminal Vim implementations (ex. MacVim)
      * value for each is an attribute list
    - can specify styles in a term, cterm, or gui attribute list
      * bold, italic, underline, reverse, inverse, standout, and NONE (to reset)
    - can specify colors
      * using ctermfg, ctermbg, guifg, and guibg
      * using Vim color names, color numbers, or RGB hex values
        - see :help cterm-colors for color numbers and names
          * the asterisk after color numbers means add 8
        - see :help gui-colors
        - color names are case-insensitive
    - in the following example, JavaScriptComment is a syntax group
    - ex. highlight JavaScriptComment ctermfg=green guifg=#00ff00
    - this approach doesn't honor user specified color schemes
      that assign highlighting to language-independent syntax groups
      * ex. Comment instead of JavaScriptComment
      * to link the styling from one syntax group to another
        - higlight link JavaScriptComment Comment

Statusline
- to customize
  set statusline={content}
  * does it need to begin with %?
- can contain special character sequences starting with %
  that are replaced by certain values
  - - left-justify the next item
  < - truncate next item if it's too long (how is this determined?)
  \  - literal space
  b - decimal value of character under cursor
  B - hex value of character under cursor
  c - current cursor column number
  f - path to file being edited
  F - full path to file being edited
  h - [Help] when viewing a Vim help file
  H - ,HLP when viewing a Vim help file
  l - current cursor line number
  m - [+] if current file has been modified and not saved; [-] otherwise
  M - ,+ if current file has been modified and not saved, ,- otherwise
  n - buffer number
  p - percentage of the last visible line number (100 if last line is visible)
  P - not sure how this differs from %p
  q - [Quickfix List] or [Location List] if either of those is being displayed
  r - [RO] if current file is read-only
  R - ,RO if current file is read-only
  t - file name (tail) of file being edited
  y - file type in buffer, ex. [vim]
  Y - file type in buffer, ex. ,VIM
  = - ends left-justified items and begins right-justified items
  -n. - sets next group to occupy n characters
  ( - begins a new group
  ) - ends current group
  #name - starts highlight group with given name
- can contain function calls that are replaced by returned string
  * ex. %!FnName()
  * called every time status line is displayed
- can contain VimL expressions
  * ex. %{some-expr}
  * evaluated every time status line is displayed

System Commands
- to execute a shell command and get its output as a string
  let result = system(command)

Types (6)
- Dictionary (map)
  * unordered collection of key/value pairs
  * literal syntax: {key: value, ...}
  * keys must be Strings or Numbers (automatically converted to Strings)
    - String keys must be surrounded by quotes
  * values can be any type including Dictionary
  * to add a pair of modify an existing value for a key
      myDict[key] = value
  * to get a value for a given key
    myDict[key] or myDict.key
  * to get a value for a given nested key (when value is a Dictionary)
    myDict[key1][key2]
  * to remove a pair, ???
  * to iterate over the keys, ???
- Float
  * to convert a String to a Float, str2float(string)
  * to convert a Float to a Number, float2nr(float)
  * the result of using an arithmetic operator
    on a Float and a Number is a Float
- Funcref
  * reference to a function
  * variable name must start uppercase just like function names
  * can set to a previously defined function with
    let MyRef = function('Name')
  * can call with call MyRef(args)
  * to get name, string(MyRef)
    * returns "function('Name')", so have to parse out name
- List
  * literal syntax: [item0, item1, ...]
  * uses zero-based indexes
  * to get length, len(list)
  * to get item at given index, myList[index]
  * to output all the items in a List
    for item in myList
      echomsg('item = ' . item)
    endfor
  * to assign all items in a List to different variables,
    [v1, v2, v3] = myList
    - # of variables must match # of elements in List!
  * to add item to end, call add(list, item)
  * to set the value at a given index, let list[index] = value
  * to remove item at given index, call remove(list, index)
  * to insert item at given index,
    moving current item at that index to next highest index,
    call insert(list, item, index)
  * to sort a list, call sort(list)
    - properly sorts numbers and strings in ascending order
    - if list contains both numbers and strings,
      strings move to beginning and numbers to end
  * to make a shallow copy of a list,
    let shallow = copy(myList)
  * to make a deep copy of a list,
    let deep = deepcopy(myList)
  * to get a slice of a list,
    let slice = myList[startIndex:endIndex]
    - both indexes are inclusive
    - if startIndex is omitted, it is 0
    - if endIndex is omitted, it is the last index
    - can specify negative values to count from end
      * -1 is index of last item
- Number
  * precede octal literals with zero (0)
  * precede hexadecimal literals zero and x or X (0x)
  * all other numbers are assumed to be decimal
  * preceding a String variable with + converts it to a Number
  * to increment a number variable, let n += 1
  * to decrement a number variable, let n -= 1
- String
  * surround with single (preferred) or double quotes
    - single keeps all characters as-is
      without honoring escape sequences like \n for a newline
    - double honors escape sequences
    - to see the difference, enter these:
      echo 'foo\nbar'
      echo "foo\nbar"
  * special characters like \n need to be
    escaped in single quoted strings (\\n),
    but not in double quoted strings
  * to compare strings
    - case-sensitive: s1 ==# s2
    - case-insensitive: s1 ==? s2
  * in a boolean context, a string are first coerced to number
    - strings that do not start with digits are coerced to zero
    - zero is treated as false and all other numbers are treated as true
    - so code inside "if text" where text does not begin with digits
      will not execute
  * concatenated with dot (.) operator
  * to concatenate to a string variable v,
    let v .= someString
  * to get length, len(string)
  * to convert to all uppercase, toupper(string)
  * to convert to all lowercase, tolower(string)
  * to convert any kind of value to string, string(value)
  * to get a slice of a String,
    let slice = myString[startIndex:endIndex]
    - both indexes are inclusive
    - if startIndex is omitted, it is 0
    - if endIndex is omitted, it is the last index
    - can specify negative values to count from end
      * -1 is index of last item
  * to get the last character,
    myString[-1:-1]
  * to get a substring without the last character,
    for example, to remove a newline character,
    myString[:-2]
  * to split a String into a List of Strings based on a delimiter,
    split(string, delimiter)
- no boolean type
  * use 0 for false and non-zero for true (typically 1)
- to get the type of a variable, type(var)
  * returns a number from 0 to 5
  * 0=Number, 1=String, 2=FuncRef, 3=List, 4=Dictionay, 5=Float
- to test the type of a variable
  * if type(var) == number-above
  or
  * if type(var) == type(example)
    - ex. if type(var) == type(1.0) " if Number

Operators
- arithmetic
  * +, -, *, /, % (mod)
- assignment
  * must start with "let" keyword!
    - let foo = 'bar', not foo = 'bar'
  * =, +=, -=, .= (string concatenate and assign)
  * no *=, /=, or %= ?
- logical
  * && (and), || (or), ! (not)
- relational
  * ==, !=, <, <=, =>, >
  * when comparing strings,
    == depends on user setting of ignorecase option
    - to force case-sensitive comparison, use ==#
    - to force case-insensitive comparison, use ==?

Options
- to see value, echo &{name}
  * when & is omitted it looks for a variable
- to set a global value
  * set {name}={value}
    - value must be a literal
  or
  * let &{name} = {value}
    - value can be a variable or function call
- to set a local value (only for current window)
  * setlocal {name}={value}
    - value must be a literal
  or
  * let &l:{name} = {value}

Registers
- to set, let @{letter} = {value}
- to see value, echo @{name}
- when text is yanked without specifying a register,
  it goes to the unnamed register "

System commands
- a.k.a. shell commands
- to run, shell(cmd)
  * returns output as a String

User commands
- must start with uppercase letter
- they call built-in commands
- to define a command that calls a function
  command CmdName call FnName()
  * to invoke the command
    :CmdName
- if command needs to pass n arguments to a function
  command -nargs=n CmdName call FnName(<args>)
  * to invoke the command
    :CmdName arg1 arg2 ...
  * <args> is replaced by the arguments
  * to replace all command-line arguments (space-separated)
    with a single, quoted string containing all the values,
    use <q-args> instead of <args>
- to overwrite a previously defined command,
  use command! instead of command
- to determine if a given command Foo exists,
  if (exists(':Foo')) ...
- to make a command local to buffers with a specific file type,
  define the command in an ftplugin file for the file type
  and include the -buffer option
  * ex. command -buffer ...

Variables
- to declare, let foo
- to declare and set, let foo = 'bar'
- to declare and set multiple variables,
  let [var1, var2, ...] = [val1, val2, ...]
  * must have same number of variables and values
  * RHS can be a List
- to set a buffer local variable
  let b:{name} = {value}
- scope prefixes
  a: argument
  g: global
  l: local to a function
  s: script
  b: buffer
  w: window
- if no scope prefix is used,
  the default scope is local inside functions
  and global otherwise

Windows
- to open a new window and move to it, execute 'new'
- to open a new window that displays a given file,
  and move to it, execute 'new file-path'
