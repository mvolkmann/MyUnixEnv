Notes on using UNIX and Linux

Ant
- To use a version of Ant that is in your PATH
  instead of the version included with Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core,
  su root
  rpm -e ant ant-libs (erases the named packages)
  exit
  hash -r (see PATH below)

Apache Bench
- To test response time of sending an HTTP request many times,
  ab -n{total-requests} -c{concurrent-requests} {url}
- lots of useful data in output, but in particular see
  * Time taken for tests
  * Requests per second
  * Time per request (mean)

ASCII characters
- To see a list of all the ASCII characters and their codes,
  enter "man ascii"
- To dump the ASCII characters in a text file
  od -cx {file-path}
  The -c option causes it to print ASCII characters
  using backslash escapes for control characters.
  The -x option causes it to output inverted pairs of hex ASCII codes.

Awk
- To replace given text in a set of files with new text,
  * In this example we'll replace "foo" with "bar"
    in all the .java files in the current directory.
  for file in *.java; do
    mv $file $file.orig
    awk -e '{ if ($0 == "foo") print "bar"; else print $0 }' $file.orig > $file
  done
- also see AwkNotes.txt

bc - a line-oriented calculator
- To convert decimal numbers to hex
  obase=16
  enter any decimal number and it will be output as hex
- To convert hex numbers to decimal
  ibase=16
  enter any hex number and it will be output as decimal
- To exit, enter "quit".

Command Recall
- to recall the last command with a given prefix
  ESC /prefix
- to execute the last command with a given prefix
  !prefix

Creating Directories
- To create directories whose parent directories don't exist yet,
  mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
  For example, mkdir -p com/ociweb/demo

Curl
- The ampersands separating query parameters must be preceded by backslashes.
- Surround url in single or double quotes if it contains special characters
  like double quotes.
- To specify a request body for a POST or PUT
  * -d '{body-payload}'
- To use a verb other than GET which is the default, use -X{verb}
  * ex. curl -XPUT http://localhost:3000 -d '{body-payload}'
- To specify the body content type
  * -H "Content-Type: {type}"
  * for example, application/json
- To put data from a text file
  * ex. curl -XPUT http://localhost:3000 -H"Content-Type: application/json" --data @security.json
  * ex. curl http://localhost:3000/security/admin/rights/%2F
- To put data from a binary file
  * ex. curl -XPUT http://localhost:3000 -H"Content-Type: image/png" --data-binary @{file-path}
- To specify output to be added after successful output, use -o
  * for example, to add a newline,
    curl -w'\n' http://java.ociweb.com/mark/
- To see headers,
  curl -i {url}
- To send a HEAD requests
  * use --head or -I, not -XHEAD

Default Shell
- To change, enter "ypchsh".

Desktops
- To switch to a different desktop, Ctrl-Tab.

Diff
- To get lines missing in first file and present in second file
  * verify that the two files are sorted
  * comm -13 file1.txt file2.txt
  * if the lines are not sorted
    - diff --new-line-format="gronk:%L" | grep "^gronk" | sed 's/gronk://'
      where "gronk" is just some unique string
      that is used to filter out only the relevant lines
      and sed is used to remove that unique prefix

Disk Space
- To determine top offenders in disk space usage,
  du -sk * | sort -rn | head
  -s = summarize
  -k = --blocksize=1K
  -r = reverse
  -n = sort as numeric
  head defaults to showing only first 10
  (really slow!)

- To list the files in the current directory from largest to smallest,
  ls -lS

- To find the largest files in and below the current directory,
  find . -type f -size +1M -exec ls -lk {} \; | sort -nr -k 5 | head
  The "-size +1M" limits processing to files that are at least one megabyte.
  The "-nr" options for sort are numeric-sort and reverse.
  This dramatically improves performance.

Display
- To allow other Linux boxes to display to yours
  * on yours execute "xhost +"
  * on theirs execute "export DISPLAY={host}:0.0"
    then run application that generates the display
    (at Boeing your host is b878360.stl.mo.boeing.com)
- Auto-scroll
  * When Linux thinks the display aspect ratio differs
    from that of the current resolution setting,
    it auto-scrolls when the mouse moves off an edge of the screen.
    To fix this, change the resolution and then change it back.

Directory Structure
- To see the content of the current directory
  including subdirectories as a tree, enter "tree".
- install on Mac with "brew install tree"

Environment Variables
- To set in bash,
  export name=value
- To unset in bash,
  unset name

Find
- If the first argument starts with -
  then the search begins in the current directory
  * in other words "find . -name 'foo.bar'"
    is the same as "find -name 'foo.bar'"
- grep
  - stands for Global Regular Expression Print
  - It came from the ed editor command g/RE/p
    where RE is replaced by a regular expression.
    It globally operates on every line in the file
    and prints all lines that match the regular expression.
- To find all files of a given type in and below the current directory
  that contain a given string,
  find -name '*.{type}' | xargs grep "{string}"
  You can also use
  find -name '*.{type}' -exec grep "{string}" {} \;
- If only files in the current directory are needed,
  grep "{string}" *.{type}
- When -name is omitted, it defaults to -name '*'.
- To output only file names containing a match and not the matching lines
  find -name '*.{type}' | xargs grep -l "{string}"
- To find all .h and .cpp files that contain "foo",
  find -regex ".*[.h|.cpp]" | xargs grep foo
- To avoid "Permission denied" messages
  when find tries to search certain directories,
  find -name 'whatever' 2> /dev/null
- To find all directories that contain files
  that have been modified today,
  find . -ctime -1 -type d
- To find all files in and below the current directory
  whose contents have been modified in the last n days,
  find . -type f -mtime -n
- To edit all the files that contain a given string,
  vim $(find -name '*.filetype' | xargs grep -l "string")
- To find all files that contain text that matches a regular expression,
  for example, .h files that define a class that inherits from another (:),
  find . -name '*.h' -exec grep -E 'class \w+ :' {} \;
- To find all files with a given extension that are executable
  and make them not executable
  find . -name '*.{ext}' -perm 001 -exec chmod a-x {} \;
  * the 001 is mask that specifies the x bit
- To limit the depth of the search (# of directories deep),
  add -maxdepth n

FTP
- See notes on ncftp in CygwinNotes.txt
- Don't forget to enter "binary" before attempting to put binary files.
- ~/.netrc can be used to reduce typing required.
  * To register username/password for specific machines,
    add one line like the following for each machine:
    machine {name-or-IP-address} login {username} password {password}
  * To create macros of FTP commands
    such as updating a file and quitting,
    macdef uploadExe
      lcd <YOUR_EXECUTABLE_DIR>
      binary
      put <EXECUTABLE_NAME>
      quit
    There must be a blank line after the last macdef!
    It may be necessary to place macdefs immediately after
    the machine definitions where they will be used.
    This will require duplicating macros that need to be
    used on multiple machines.
  * To use the .netrc file, enter "ftp {name-or-IP-address}"
  * To execute an FTP command and capture its output in a file
    echo "{command}" | ftp {name-or-IP-address} > ftp.txt
  * To run a macro from an FTP prompt, "${macro-name}".
  * To run a macro from the command line,
    "echo "\${macro-name}" | ftp {name-or-IP-address}
  * To see all the commands that a macro executes
    - if running macro from ftp prompt, start ftp with -d 
    - if running macro from command line, start ftp with -v 

Functions
- to see the definition of a function defined in some script
  that has been run (perhaps .bashrc), enter "type {function-name}"

Graphics files
- to display a graphics file such as a .png file,
  use the "Eye of Gnome" application by entering "eog {file-path}"

Hex
- To see the hex characters in the output of a command
  {command} | od -cx

Home Directory Mount
- To force someone else's home directory to be mounted on your Linux box,
  sudo su - {their-id}
  Use your root password.
  Lisa's id is eo054c.

Host
- To determine name of current host, enter "hostname".

IP address
- To determine the IP address of the current host (four ways)
  * google "what is my ip"
  * run /sbin/ifconfig and look for en0 (wired) or en1 (wireless) inet addr
    - on some machines, ifconfig is in /sbin
  * run ipconfig and look for the en0 (wired) or en1 (wireless) inet addr
  * nslookup {hostname}

Konsole
- To open a new session (tab), Ctrl-Shift-N.
- To move to a different session, Shift-Left or Right.
- To move current session left or right, Ctrl-Shift-Left or Right.
- To rename a session, Alt-Ctrl-S.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
- lists directories to be searched for library files (such as .so files)
- you wrote a Ruby script to output this so each piece is on a separate line
  * see $HOME/Ruby/ld.rb
  * alias set in .bashrc is ld

List Directory Contents
- To show hidden files, ls -a
- To show details, ls -l
  * extended attribuets
    - the last position in the permissions string
      contains @ if the file has "extended attributes"
    - to list them, xattr {file-path}
    - to delete one, xattr -d {extended-attr-name} {file-path}
- To sort on creation time with newest files first, ls -lt
- To use color, alias ls='ls --color=tty'
  (directories are blue, executables are green)

List Library Contents
- Use nm command which outputs lines containing symbol value, type and name.
- To unmangle symbol names for C++ methods, pipe nm output to c++filt.
- The symbol type is output before each symbol in the library:
  A - absolute, won't change by further linking
  B - uninitialized
  C - common
  D - initialized
  G - initialized for small objects
  I - indirect reference to another symbol
  N - debugging symbol (use -a to see these)
  R - read only
  S - uninitialized for small objects
  T - text (code)
  U - undefined
  V - weak object
  W - weach symbol
  - - a "stabs" symbol
  ? - unknown

Locate
- This command searches a database for a filename
  and outputs all the locations where it resides.
- The database is typically updated every night for all files on the drive.
- Usage: locate {filename}

Mail
- To fetch mail from another mail server to the local Linux box,
  fetchmail -v -k
  -v is for verbose output
  -k keeps mail on the server from which it is fetching
- Use "mail" or "mutt" to read the email.  See MuttNotes.txt
  which also describes using cron to periodically run fetchmail.
- Gilstrap suggests using Postfix (formerly Sendmail)
  to send email using IMAP (http://postfix.org)
- Gilstrap suggests creating your own email server using
  the University of Washington IMAP Server software

Make
- To see commands that make would execute without executing them,
  make -n 
- Use MPC to generate makefiles for various platforms

Man Pages
- to save a man page in a text file that can be printed
  * man {command} | col -b > {command}.txt
- to save it in a much more appealing Postscript format
  * man -t {command} > {command}.ps

Messages
- To send a message to a particular user that they will see
  at their command prompt, "write {user-name}".
  After that, each line you type is sent to them when you press the enter key.
  They can do the same to you in order to have a conversation.
- To send a message to all users on your current host, "wall {message}".

Mount
- If your home directory is actually mounted from somewhere else
  (such as an NIS server), to see where, cd to your home directory
  and enter "df .".
  * this is the case at Boeing
- To see all directories that are mounted from somewhere else,
  enter "df | grep :" or "mount | grep :".
- To mount USB drives that are detected by automount,
  * run "dmesg" to see what device name was assigned (ex. sda1 or sdb2)
  * run "ls /media" to see what device names it assigned (ex. WD_Combo or ipod)
  * mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /media/WD_Combo
  * mount -t vfat /dev/sdb2 /media/ipod
  * there should be a way to make these mounts happen automatically on reboot
    but I haven't figured that out
- /etc/fstab (stands for File System TABle)
  - lists all file system devices that are mounted, and their options
  - is this automatically updated by the mount command?
- automount
  * responsible for dynamically mounting USB devices
  * to stop it, run "/etc/init.d/autofs stop"
  * to start it, run "/etc/init.d/autofs start"

Mouse
- Double-click or drag across text to select it.
- Click middle mouse button to paste selected text.

Panel Buttons
- To add one,
  right-click on existing panel
  Panel Menu ... Add to Panel ... Special Button ... Non-KDE Application
- To add a file browser (Konqueror) icon to button panel
  right-click on existing panel
  Panel Menu ... Add to Panel ... Application ... Home
- To add a "Terminal" icon to button panel
  right-click in panel
  Panel Menu ... Add to Panel ... Application ... System Tools ... Terminal

Netstat
- To see which ports are currently being listened on by some server
  netstat -an | grep LISTEN

Password
- To change password
  passwd [username]
  To change to a dictionary word, su root and ignore warnings.

Patch
- To create a patch file,
  diff {file1} {file2} > {name}.patch
- To apply a patch file to a file,
  patch ???

PATH
- This environment variable contains a list of directories
Identify areas of concern when using Java threads alone and together with C++ threads.
Document the behavior of Java threads, how their behavior can be configured, and their interaction with C++ threads.
Design, implement and document a testing framework for measuring the impact of various implementation and tuning approaches.
Present all the information gathered in a teleconference.
Assist NSIT in running the testing framework to gather results on the target platform.
Modify the testing framework based on feedback from NSIT.
  to be searched for executables.
- After an executable is run once, it's location can be remembered.
- If PATH is changed later, you may have to run "hash -r"
  to get the OS to forget all executable locations it was remembering.

Ports
- to find the process listening on a given port, use "list open files"
  lsof -i :{port-number}

Printing
- To get name of default printer,
  lpstat -d
- To print source files using enscript
  alias ens="enscript --borders --columns=2 --fancy-header \
             --landscape --line-numbers=1 --mark-wrapped-lines=arrow \
             --pretty-print=cpp --printer=bstl0860"
  ens {filename}.cpp

Processes
- $! holds the process id (PID) of the last process that was spawned using &
  * for example,
    some-executable&
    pid=$!
    # do some work
    kill -9 $pid
- best way to kill
  * Unless a program was written to catch a specific signal, the best way
    to try to kill it is the Software Termination signal (SIGTERM - 15).
    This is the default signal for the kill command if none is specified.
    syntax: kill {pid}
    Well-written *nix applications catch this signal and terminate gracefully.
  * If this fails, try these in order.
    - hangup - SIGHUP(1): kill -1 {pid}
    - interrupt - SIGINT(2) (sent by a ctrl-c): kill -2 {pid}
    - quit program - SIGQUIT(3) (causes a core dump): kill -3 {pid}
    - abort - SIGABRT(6): kill -6 {pid} (should also cause a core dump)
    - kill - SIGKILL(9): kill -9 {pid} (uncatchable)
  * If a process won't die and you're curious about why, attach a gdb session.
    After poking around, do a "quit" without detaching
    which should kill the process.
  * Sun's JVM uses SIQQUIT(3) as a signal to dump all the running threads.
- Defunct processes used to be called zombie processes.
  They are neither dead nor alive.
  They are processes that have become corrupted in such a way
  that they no long can communicate with their parent or child process.
  Killing the parent or child process will usually make them go away.
  If the parent or child process is missing, you're out of luck.
  Possibly there is a stuck automount.
  Of course rebooting the machine will get rid of them.

Reading a Windows NTFS drive from Linux
- To install the NTFS module,
  browse to http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/rpm/fedora4.html
  download the appropriate RPM for your platform
Identify areas of concern when using Java threads alone and together with C++ threads.
Document the behavior of Java threads, how their behavior can be configured, and their interaction with C++ threads.
Design, implement and document a testing framework for measuring the impact of various implementation and tuning approaches.
Present all the information gathered in a teleconference.
Assist NSIT in running the testing framework to gather results on the target platform.
Modify the testing framework based on feedback from NSIT.
  and install the RPM (requires root password).
- To mount the Windows C drive on a dual boot machine,
  enter "su -" and
  enter "mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/c".
  /dev/hda represents the entire first IDE drive.
  /dev/hda1 represents the first partition on this drive
  which is the Windows C drive.
  If there is a Windows D drive on the same IDE drive,
  that would be represented by /dev/hda2.
- To read files from this mount point,
  enter "cd /mnt/c; ls".
- When finished using the mount, enter "umount /mnt/c".
- To see a list of all active mounts, enter "mount -l".
- To automatically mount the Windows C drive,
  add the following line to /etc/fstab.
  /dev/hda1 /mnt/c ntfs auto,user,noexec,ro,async,umask=000 0 0
  * auto means automatically mount it
  * user means all normal users to mount it
  * noexec means don't allow executables on the mount to be run
  * ro means enforce read-only access
  * async means allow reads and writes to occur asynchronously
  * next zero means don't backup files on this mount with dump
  * next zero means don't check files on this mount with fsck
- To perform all mounts marked as auto in /etc/fstab,
  enter "mount -a".

Redhat Package Manager (RPM)
- To determine the packages that have been installed,
    
- To determine the proper RPM versions to download,
  run the whichrpm script in /home/mvolkmann.
- To determine the version of Red Hat you have,
  enter "cat /etc/redhat-release".
- To determine the kernel version you have,
  enter "uname -r".
  This information is also output by whichrpm.
- To install an RPM from the command-line,
  rpm -i {pkg-name}.rpm
- To uninstall (erase) a package,
  rpm -e {pkg-name}  
- Often a package depends on other packages that need to be installed first.
  The rpm command will provide a list of missing dependencies.

Script Command Echoing
- To see each command that is executed in a script named foo,
  sh -x foo

Secure Copy
- To avoid being prompted for a password, see notes on ssh-keygen below.
- To copy a file to another host,
  scp file-name {user-name}@{host}:{file-path}
- To copy a file from another host,
  scp {user-name}@{host}:{file-path} .
- To copy a directory from another host,
  scp -r {user-name}@{host}:{dir-path} .
- To copy a file to your home directory on another host,
  scp {file-path} {user-name}@{host}:

Shell Prompt
- To customize shell prompt in bash,
  export PS1="prompt"
  Escape sequences that can be used in prompt include
  \H - host name
  \u - user name
  \w - current working directory
  Recommended prompt is "\w$ ".

Shell Scripts
- To specify the type of script, in this example using bash,
  make the following the first line.
  #!/bin/bash
- To cause every command in a script that is executed to be echoed,
  add the following near the top of the script.
  set -x
  (also see "set -v")

SSH
- download PuTTY from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
  * need putty.exe, pageant.exe and plink.exe
  * see C:\Program Files\PuTTY on your laptop
- need public and private SSH keys
  * yours are in C:\OCI\OCI_Putty_*_key.ppk
- double-click the Pageant icon on your laptop desktop (needed?)
- add the environment variable SVN_SSH="ssh -l volkmanm -P 12345"
- to generate a new SSH key
  - run C:\Program Files\PuTTY\puttygen.exe on laptop
  - select "SSH2 DSA" radio button near bottom of dialog
  - click the "Generate" button
  - move the mouse over the "Key" area
    until the progress bar goes all the way to the right
  - copy the public key by selecting it with the mouse and pressing Ctrl-C
    (using the "Save public key" button saves it in a form
     that the OCI SSH server can't use)
  - save the private key by pressing the "Save private key" button
  - add the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the OCI hickory server
- to test that the SSH key is working properly, from a command prompt,
  enter "putty -i {path-to-private-key-file} volkmanm@ssh.ociweb.com"
- to avoid being prompted for a password
  * on source machine
    - enter ssh-keygen (accept all the defaults; don't enter a passphrase)
    - use ftp or scp to copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the destination machine
  * on destination machine
    - mkdir .ssh
    - mv id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

stdout and stderr
- to redirect both to the same place
  command > file 2>&1
  or (bash only)
  command &> file

Switch User (su and sudo)
- To switch to the root user,
  enter "su root" or just "su".
- To switch to the root user AND get its enviroment (ex. PATH),
  enter "su - root" or just "su -".
- sudo does a "switch user" and then executes some command
- At Boeing you can use "sudo su" to switch to the root id.
  To verify that it worked, enter "id" which should show that uid is root.

Symbolic Links
- To create a symbolic link,
  enter "ln -s {target-file} {link-name}"
- Suggested use
  * directories for installed libraries and applications under /opt
    should include version numbers
  * create a symbolic link for each whose name doesn't include the version
  * refer to these symbolic links in applications that use them
  * when new versions are installed, only the symbolic links
    need to be changed, not the applications that use them

Tar
- To tar the contents of a directory named d
  cd to the parent directory
  tar zcf d.tgz d
  * .tgz is typically preferred over .tar.gz
  * The above is shorthand for the following:
    tar cf d.tar d
    gzip d.tar # creates d.tgz
  * the last two steps can be compbined into one with
- To untar a gzipped tar file f.tgz
  tar zxf f.tgz
  * tar now infers the z option.
  * The above is shorthand for the following:
    gunzip f.tgz # or gzip -d f.tgz
    tar xf f.tar
- To untar a bz2 tar file f.bz2
  tar xvjpf f.bz2
- To tar only files found using the find command:
  tar xf myfiles.tar `find ...`
- See your pkg and unpkg scripts that make it easier to
  tar/zip and unzip/untar directories.

Threads
- Some versions of UNIX/Linux don't support thread priorities.
- NPTL stands for New POSIX Thread Library
- RedHat Enterprise 3 uses the 2.4.21 kernel which uses NPTL.
- Fedora probably uses NPTL.
- To enable thread priorities, switch to older thread library with
  export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1
- Have to run as root to assign thread priorities.

Time
- To find out how long it takes to execute a given command,
  time {command}

Tunnels
- needed to access OCI machines when not on the internal network
  * not in the office with an ethernet cable plugged in
- configured by ~/.ssh/config
- can also be controlled by Applications/Utilities/SSH Tunnel Manager
  * run SSH Tunnel Manager
    - verify that it has a tunnel named "spider" with
      * Login = volkmanm
      * Host = ssh.ociweb.com
      * Port = 22
      * Local redirection: 12346, spider, 22
  * press play button for spider
- to run X11 applications from spider
  * open a Terminal window
  * if on the OCI network
    - ssh to spider by entering "spider"
      which is an alias for "ssh -X volkmanm@spider.ociweb.com"
      (-X enables X11 forwarding)
  * if not on the OCI network
    - ssh to hickory by entering "ssh -X volkmanm@ssh.ociweb.com"
    - from hickory, ssh to spider by entering "ssh -X spider"
  * to test that this is working, enter "xeyes"
    and verify that you see the X11 application
- the following information probably only works when using SSH Tunnel Manager
  * to ssh to spider from your Mac, enter "ssh -p12346 -lvolkmanm localhost
  * to scp a file to spider, enter "scp -P12346 {file-path} volkmanm@localhost:

Version
- To get UNIX version,
  uname -a
  Under Linux, the 3rd piece of data is the Linux kernel version.
  At Boeing it's Linux 2.4.21-15.EL and VxWorks 6.1.
- To get RedHat version,
  cat /etc/redhat-release
  At Boeing it's Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS release 3 (Taroon Update 2).
- To get the thread library version,
  getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION
  At Boeing it's NPTL 0.60.
  NPTL stands for New POSIX Thread Library.

Windows
- To minimize all windows, ctrl-alt-d.
- To cycle between windows, ctrl-alt-tab.

Yum package manager
- used to upgrade Linux and other software
- To install
  * download from http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/download/2.4
  * make
  * make install

Zip
- To create a zip file named foo.zip containing
  all the files in and below the directory bar
  zip -r foo bar
- To unzip .bz2 files, use "bunzip2 {name}.bz2".
- To list the files inside a zip file,
  zipinfo foo.zip
