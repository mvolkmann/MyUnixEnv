# Go For It! Part 2

This article is the second in a multi-part series on the Go programming language.
It provides details on the syntax of the language.

The first article in the series is available at
<https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/november-2018-way-to-go-part-1>.
It provides an overview of the language and a quick-start guide.

Future articles will cover the Go standard library, concurrency, reflection,
solutions to common tasks, modules, testing, and the future of Go.

## Go Syntax

### Overview

A Go source file contains a package clause,
followed by zero or more import declarations,
followed by zero or more package-level declarations.
Package clauses and import declarations
are described in the next two sections.

A package-level declaration is a declaration of a package
constant, variable, type, function, or method.
All of these begin with a keyword which is one of
`const`, `var`, `type`, or `func`.
These declarations can appear in any order.
They are the only statements that can appear outside of functions.
This precludes use of the `:=` operator and
non-declaration statements, like `if` and `for`,
outside of functions.

Types follow variable and parameter names, separated by a space.
For example, `var score int`.

Semicolons are not required, but can be used
to place multiple statements on the same line.
However, the `gofmt` code formatting tool
will place each statement on a separate line
and remove semicolons.

### Packages

All Go code resides in some package.

Each source file must begin with a package clause
that is the keyword "package" followed by a package name.
The package name must match the name of the directory that
holds the file, unless the package name is `main`.
This defines a namespace for the names it defines.
For example, if a directory named `astronomy` contains the file `planets.go`,
the first non-comment line in the file should be `package astronomy`.

A package is defined by a collection of
Go source files in a single directory.
The source files that define a package
can have any file name that ends in `.go`.

All names defined in a package are visible
in all source files of the package.
Exported names of a package start with an uppercase letter and
are visible in source files of other packages that import the package.
Unexported names start wth a lowercase letter and
are not visible in the source files of other packages.

Go convention is for package names to be
all lowercase without underscores or hyphens.
This precludes the use of camelcase names.

The `main` function is the starting point of all Go applications
and must defined in a source file that starts with `package main`.

Changing a package name requires renaming the directory and
modifying the `package` statement in all the files that define it.
Editorial: It seems Go missed an opportunity to
infer the package name from the directory name.

### Imports

An `import` statement imports all the exported names in given packages.
The imported names are available in the source file
containing the `import` statement, but are not automatically
available in other source files of the same package.
It is not possible to import just a subset
of the names exported by a given package.

To import one package, `import "pkgName"`.

To import multiple packages,

```go
import (
    "pkgName1"
    "pkgName2"
    ...
 )
```

Unused imports are treated as errors
and some tools automatically remove them.
This avoids accumulating imports that are
no longer needed as the code is modified.

An alternate name for a package name can be defined
with `import altName "pkgName"`.
Note that the alternate name is not surrounded by quotes,
but the package name is.
When an alternate name is defined,
exported names in the package must be
referenced with `altName.ExportedName`
instead of `pkgName.ExportedName`.

The full name used to import a package is referred to as its "import path".
These are slash-separated names.
For standard library packages, the import path is a simple name
such as `"strings"` or `"math/rand"`.
For community packages, the import path
is the package URL without the scheme portion
and the double-slashes that follow it.
For example, to import the package at
<https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter>
use `import "github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter"`.
This binds the short name `httprouter` so it can be used
for accessing the names exported by the package.

Refer to the names exported by an imported package
by preceding them with the package name followed by a period,
for example, `httprouter.ResponseWriter`.
It is not possible to add the exported names to the current namespace
to avoid using the `pkgName.` prefix.

Packages used by an application or by other packages are not required
to have unique names, but their import paths must be unique.
For example, the import paths `alpha/one` and `beta/one` can coexist
even though the package name for both is `one`.
However, to use both in the same source file,
one of them must be given an alternate name.

Circular imports where an import triggers the
import of the current package are treated as errors.

### Package Initialization

Initialization of package-level variables that require logic,
not just literal values or results of function calls,
must be done in `init` functions.
These have no parameters and no return value.

A package can have any number of `init` functions
in any of its source files.
These functions are run in the order they appear
and alphabetically by source file name within a package.

The `init` functions of all imported packages are
run before those of the package that imports them.
All `init` functions of all imported packages are run
before the `main` function of an application is run.

### Names

Names for variables, types, functions, methods, and parameters
must begin with a unicode letter and can contain
unicode letters, unicode digits, and underscores.

Go convention is for multi-word names to use camelcase and
for acronyms in them to have all their letters in the same case.
For example, `xmlHTTPRequest`.

The `golint` tool requires some well-known acronyms in names
to use the same case for all their letters.
These include ASCII, HTML, ID, JSON, URL, and XML.

### Comments

Comments in Go use the same syntax as C.

Multi-line comments use `/* ... */`.
These cannot be nested.
They are primarily used for the comment at the top of a package
and to temporarily comment out sections of code.

Single-line comments use `// ...`.
These are used for all other kinds of comments,
even those preceding functions.

A single-line comment should precede each exported declaration.
These are used by the `go doc` and `godoc` tools to generate documentation.

### Zero Values

Every type has a "zero value" which is
the value it takes on when it is not initialized.
This means that all variables have a value.

The table below mentions "slices".
These are described in detail in the "Slices" section.
For now think of a slice as an array with a variable length.
Arrays in Go have a fixed length.

| Type                       | Zero Value                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bool                       | false                                                           |
| all numeric types          | 0                                                               |
| rune (single character)    | 0                                                               |
| string                     | ""                                                              |
| array                      | array of proper length where all elements have their zero value |
| slice                      | empty slice with length 0 and capacity 0                        |
| map                        | empty map                                                       |
| struct                     | struct where all fields have their zero value                   |
| pointers & all other types | nil                                                             |

### Variables

#### Variable Characteristics

Variables in Go are mutable unless primitive and defined with `const`.

Variables are block-scoped within functions, so
those in inner scopes can shadow those in outer scopes.

Package-level variables are local to the package
unless their name starts with an uppercase letter.

Go distinguishes between declaring, initializing, and assigning variables.

#### Package-level Variables

Variables that are declared outside of functions (package-level)
must be declared with a `var` statement.
This accepts a type, an initial value, or both.
The initial value can be any expression
that yields a value of the desired type.
Examples include:

```go
var name string // defaults to zero value for the type (empty string)
var name = "Mark" // inferred type is string
var name string = "Mark"
```

While both a type and initial value can be provided,
that is usually redundant since
the type can be inferred from the value.
Some editor plugins/extensions will warn about this.

When no type is specified, the largest matching type is assumed.
For example, in `var n = 3` the type will be `int`
and in `var n = 1.2` the type will be `float64`.

Package-level variables have package scope which means
they are accessible in all source files of the package.
They are never garbage collected and so are available for
the entire life of the application in which they are used.

Multiple variables can be declared in one `var` statement.
For example:

```go
var name, age = "Mark", 57 // must initialize all
var ( // use parens to spread over multiple lines
    name string = "Mark"
    age number // not initialized, so uses zero value
)
```

When multiple consecutive variables have the same type,
the type can be omitted from all but the last.
For example, these lines are equivalent:

```go
var n1 string, n2 string, a1 int8, a2 int8, a3 int8
var n1, n2 string, a1, a2, a3 int8
```

#### Variables in Functions

Variables that are declared inside a function are local to that function.

There are two ways to declare variables inside a function.
One is to use a `var` statement just like when outside a function.
Another is to use the short variable declaration operator `:=`
which does not allow a type to be specified and
instead infers it from the value on the right.
For example, `name := "Mark"`.

Inside function definitions the `var` form of assignment
tends to only be used for two reasons.
The first is when when a variable needs to be declared,
but not yet assigned a non-zero value.
The second is when the desired type differs
from what would be inferred from the initializer.
For example, in the following declaration the type of the variable `n`
would be `int` rather than `int8` if it was not specified:
`var n int8 = 19`.

Multiple variables can be declared with one `:=` operator.
For example, `name, age := "Mark", 57`.
An initializer must be supplied for each variable.

It is an error to attempt to declare a variable that has already
been declared, whether with a `var` statement or the `:=` operator.

Variables that have already been declared can be assigned new values
with the `=` operator. For example, `name = "Tami"`.

Multiple variables can be assigned with one `=` operator.
For example, `name, age = "Tami", 56`.
This can also be used to swap values. For example, `x, y = y, x`.
This works with any number of variables.
For example, `x, y, z = y, z, 0` assigns
the current value of `y` to `x`,
the current value of `z` to `y`, and zero to `z`.

It is an error to attempt to assign to a variable that has not been declared.

There is an exception to the rule that existing variables cannot be re-declared.
As long as at least one variable on the left of `:=` has not yet been declared,
the other variables can already exist.
A common use case is when the variable `err` is used
to capture possible errors from a function call.
For example, as long as the variable `bytes` has not been previously declared
the following statement is valid even if `err` has been previously declared.

```go
bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile("haiku.txt")
```

#### Multiple Return Values

Functions can return any number of values.
The result can be assigned to the same number of variables.
For example, if `getBounds` is a function that returns two values,
`min, max := getBounds(points)` is a valid statement.

Sometimes the caller is only interested in a subset of the return values.
The "blank identifier" `_` can be used to discard specific return values.
For example, `_, max := getBounds(points)`.

### Constants

Go constants are defined using the `const` keyword.
They must be initialized to a primitive literal or an expression
that can be computed at compile-time and results in a primitive value.
For example, `const HOT = 100`.

Non-primitive types such as arrays, slices, structs, and maps
cannot be declared with `const`.

Like with `var`, a type can be specified.
This is useful when the desired type differs from what would be inferred.
For example, `const HOT float64 = 100`.

When a constant type is not specified the constant is "untyped".
This allows them to be used in many expressions without explicit conversions.
For example, `int` and `float64` values cannot be multiplied
without converting one of the values to the other type.

```go
value := 4.5 // type is float64
const times1 = 3 // type is untyped integer
good := value * times1 // allowed
times2 := 3 // type is int
bad := value * times2 // not allowed
```

For more on untyped constants, see
<https://blog.golang.org/constants>.

### Operators

Go supports the following operators:

- arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (mod)
- arithmetic assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- increment: `++`
- decrement: `--`
- assignment: `=` (existing variable), `:=` (new variable)
- comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - Arrays are compared by comparing their elements if they are comparable.
  - Structs are compared by comparing their fields if they are comparable.
  - Slices, maps, and functions are not comparable,
    so cannot be compared using these operators.
- logical: `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not)
- bitwise: `&`, `|`, `^` (xor), `&^` (bit clear)
- bitwise assignment: `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `&^=`
- bit shift: `<<`, `>>`
- bit shift assignment: `<<=`, `>>=`
- channel direction: `<-`
- variadic parameter: `paramName ...paramType`
- slice spread: `sliceName...`
- pointer creation: `&varName`
- pointer dereference: `*pointerName`
- block delimiters: `{ }`
- expression grouping: `( )`
- function call: `fnName(args)`
- array or slice index: `arr[index]`
- map value: `map[key]`
- struct member reference: `structName.memberName`
- statement separator: `;`
- array element separator: `,`
- label definition: `someLabel:` (see `goto` keyword)

The increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators
can only be used as postfix operators.
They form statements, not expressions. This means
they cannot be used in assignment statements.
For example, `var j = i++` is not allowed.

The and (`&&`) and or (`||`) operators short-circuit
like in most programming languages. This means that if the
result is known by only evaluating the left expression,
the right expression is not evaluated.

Go does not include an exponentiation operator.
Use the standard library function
`math.Pow(base, exponent)` function for this.

Go also does not include a ternary operator.
It prefers using an `if` statement which some feel
is more clear, despite being more verbose.

### Keywords

The Go language has 25 keywords which is less than most languages.
This contributes to Go being easy to learn.
These keywords cannot be used as the names of variables,
functions, methods, parameters, interfaces, or types.
The keywords supported by Go include the following,
each of which is described in more detail later:

- `break` - breaks out of a `for` loop, `select`, or `switch`
- `case` - used in a `select` or `switch`
- `chan` - channel type for communicating between goroutines
- `const` - declares a constant
- `continue` - advances to the next iteration of a `for` loop
- `default` - the default case in a `select` or `switch`
- `defer` - defers execution of a given function until the containing function exits
- `else` - part of an `if`
- `fallthrough` - used as last statement in a `case` to execute code in next `case`
- `for` - the only loop syntax; C-style (init, condition, and post) or just a condition
- `func` - defines a named or anonymous function or method
- `go` - precedes a function call to execute it asynchronously in a goroutine
- `goto` - jumps to a given label (see `:` operator)
- `if` - for conditional logic; also see `else`
- `import` - imports all exported symbols in given packages
- `interface` - defines a set of methods;
  typically used to define a type with which all implementing types are compatible
- `map` - collection of key/value pairs where keys and values can have any specified type
- `package` - specifies the package to which the current source file belongs
- `range` - used in a `for` loop to iterate over a
  string, array, slice, map, or receiving channel
- `return` - terminates the containing function and returns zero or more values
- `select` - chooses from a set of channel send or receive operations
- `struct` - collection of fields that each have a specific type
- `switch` - alternative to `if` for choosing a block of code to execute
  based on an expression or type
- `type` - creates an alias for another type; often used to
  give a name to a struct, interface, or function signature
- `var` - defines a variable and its type, initial value, or both

There are additional predeclared names that are not reserved,
but using them in other contexts could be confusing.
These include the names of primitive types (such as `int` and `string`),
the names of built-in functions (such as `append`, `delete`, `make`, and `range`),
and constants (`true`, `false`, `iota`, and `nil`).

### Pointers

Pointers hold the address of a value.
When not set, their value is `nil`.

Pointer types begin with an asterisk.
`*Type` is the type for a pointer to a value of type `Type`.

To obtain a pointer to a variable value, use the `&` operator.
For example, `myPtr := &myVar`.
It is not possible to obtain the address of a constant value.

To create a value and get a pointer to it in one statement,
`myPtr := new(type)`.
Another way to do this which is preferred by many is
to first create a variable to hold the value
and then get a pointer to it. For example,
`var myThing ThingType; myPtr := &myThing`.
Interestingly the assembly code generated
for these two approaches is identical.

To obtain the value at a pointer, `myValue = *myPtr`.

To modify the value at a pointer, `*myPtr = newValue`.

Pointer arithmetic, as seen in C and C++, is not supported in Go.
This avoids memory safety issues and
simplifies the built-in garbage collector.

Function parameters are passed by value, so
passing a pointer to a variable is required
to allow a function to modify the variable.

### Memory Allocation

The Go specification does not indicate the situations
under which stack memory or heap memory are used.
The primary Go implementation makes some choices
based on the fact that allocating on the stack is
generally faster than allocating on the heap.

The built-in `new` function always allocates on the heap.

Variables declared in functions are typically allocated on the stack
unless access to them escapes from the function
by returning a pointer to it or setting a variable
declared outside the function to a pointer to the variable.

### Output

Writing to stdout and stderr is supported by the "fmt" package.
The `Println` method writes expression values to stdout.
Each output value is separated from the next by a single space.
A newline character is written after the last expression.
For example:

```go
fmt.Println(expr1, expr2)
```

The `Printf` function also writes to stdout.
It uses a format string similar to the C `printf` function.
For example:

```go
fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)
```

The `Printf` function will be described in more detail
in a future article on the Go standard library.

### If

In `if` statements, parentheses are not needed
around the condition being tested.
If parentheses are included, the `gofmt` tool will remove them.

Braces are required around the statements
to be executed when the condition is true.

An `else` block is optional.
When present, braces are required around the statements
to be executed when the condition is false.

For example:

```go
if x > 7 {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```

Almost any single statement can precede the condition,
separated from it by a semicolon.
However, typically an assignment statement is used.
The scope of the assigned variables are the `if` block,
including the `else` block if present. For example:

```go
if y := x * 2; y < 10 {
    ...
}
```

### Switch

The `switch` statement in Go is similar to that in other languages,
but it can switch on expressions of any type.
Braces around the body are required.

Case values can be literal values or expressions.
The `case` keyword can be followed by any number of
comma-separated expressions. Matching any of them
causes the statements for that case to be executed.
Case blocks do not fall through to the next by default so
unlike in many other languages, `break` statements are not used.
If it is desirable to fall through, use the
`fallthrough` keyword at the end of a `case` block.

A basic `switch` statement looks like the following:

```go
switch name {
    case "Mark":
        // handle Mark
    case "Tami":
        // handle Tami
    case "Amanda", "Jeremy":
        // handle Amanda or Jeremy
    default:
        // handle all other names
}
```

Braces are only needed around the statements in a `case`
to introduce a new scope for variables
that are only used by that `case`.

A `switch` statement can include an initialization statement
just like an `if` statement. For example:

```go
switch name := buildName(person); name {
    ...
}
```

The previous example could also begin with

```go
switch buildName(person) {
```

but then the name would not be available for use inside the `switch`.

A `switch` statement with no expression executes the
first `case` block whose expression evaluates to true.
This is referred to as a "tagless switch".
For example:

```go
switch {
    case name == "Mark":
        // handle Mark
    case age < 20:
        // handle youngsters
    default:
        // handle all other cases
}
```

To switch on the type of an expression
append `.(type)` to the expression.
For example:

```go
switch theType := expression.(type) {
    case int, float:
      // handle int or float
    case string:
      // handle string
    default:
      // handle all other types
}
```

The variable `theType` will hold the actual type.
`theType :=` can be omitted if not needed.
If the value of `expression` is an interface type,
`theType` will be set to the actual type that implements the interface.

### Loops

The `for` statement is the only looping statement in Go.
The syntax is `for init; cond; post { ... }`.
No parentheses are allowed around the the init, cond, and post portions.
The three parts are separated by semicolons.
The init and post parts, if present, must be single statements,
but multiple variables can be assigned in a single statement.
Braces around the body are required.

The `break` and `continue` keywords can be used inside the body.
`break` without a label exits the inner-most loop.
`continue` skips the remainder of the body and continues
at the top of the loop, testing the condition again.

For example:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    ...
}
```

When the init and post parts are omitted and only
the condition is present, the semicolons can be omitted.

A `while` loop in other languages looks like the following in Go:

```go
for i < 10 {
    ...
}
```

For an endless loop, omit the condition as follows:

```go
for {
    ...
}
```

The `range` keyword is often used in `for` loops
to iterate over string characters,
elements of arrays and slices,
and map key/value pairs.
Examples of these appear later.

### Strings

Go strings are immutable sequences of bytes representing UTF-8 characters.
Literal values are delimited with double quotes or back quotes.

An example of declaring and initializing a string
inside a function is `name := "Mark"`.

When back quotes are used, they are called "raw string literals".
These can include newline characters
and characters escaped with backslashes
(such as \n for newline and \t for tab) are not processed.
This makes them ideal for writing regular expressions
and HTML templates which sometimes contain backslashes.

The following two strings are equal:

```go
message1 := `Hello World!
This is a
Go program.`
message2 := "Hello World!\nThis is a\nGo program."
```

To get the length of a string in bytes, use the `len` function.
For example, using the variable `name` defined above,
`len(name)` returns `4`.

If the string contains any multi-byte UTF-8 characters,
the `len` function does not return the number of characters.
To get the length of a string in UTF-8 characters,
use the `unicode/utf8` package.
For example, `utf8.RuneCountInString(name)`.

To retrieve a byte from a string, use square brackets.
For example, `char := name[index]`.
Attempting to retrieve a byte at an index beyond the end
triggers a panic, which is a runtime error
that typically causes the application to terminate
(see the "Error Handling" section for more detail).

To retrieve a UTF-8 character as a rune,
use the `unicode/utf8` package.
For example, `r, size := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(name[i:])`.
`i` is the byte index of the start of the character.
`r` is set to the rune.
`size` is the number of bytes in the rune
which can be used to compute `i` for the next character.

To iterate over the UTF-8 characters in a string,
use a `for` loop with the `range` keyword.
For example, `for index, char := range name { ... }`.
Replace `index` with the blank identifier `_` if it is not needed.

To create a new string that is a substring of an existing string,
specify the starting (inclusive) and ending (exclusive) indexes
in square brackets separated by a colon. For example,
`name[m:n]` gets the characters from index `m` to just before index `n`,
`name[m:]` gets characters from `m` to the end,
`name[:n]` gets characters from the beginning to just before `n`,
and `name[:]` gets all the characters.

For efficiency, substrings share memory
with the original string rather than copying bytes.
This is safe because strings are immutable.

While strings are immutable,
variables that hold them can be assigned a different string.
For example, the following is valid: `name = name[:3]`.

To create a new string by concatenating a string to another,
use the `+` and `+=` operators.

The `string` type has no methods.
The standard library package `strings` provides
many functions for operating on strings.
Many of these will be described in a
future article on the Go standard library.
For example, the following code splits a string on
whitespace characters and prints each word on a separate line:

```go
s := "This is a test."
words := strings.Fields(s)
for _, word := range words {
    fmt.Println(word) // outputs "This", "is", "a", and "test."
}
```

### Types

The `type` keyword defines a new type.
It does not define an alias for an existing type.

For example `type score int` defines the type `score`,
but it cannot be used interchangeably with the type `int`.

```go
type score int
var s score = 1
var i int = 2
sum := s + i // invalid operation - mismatched types
```

Type names can be used as functions that convert a value
that has the same underlying type to that type.
For example, the invalid operation above can be corrected with:

```go
sum : = s + score(i) // works!
```

Type names can also be used as functions to convert between numeric types,
which is useful since math operations such as addition
require matching types. For example:

```go
a := 1 // int
b := 2.3 // float64
fmt.Println(float64(a) + b) // 3.3
fmt.Println(a + int(b)) // truncates b resulting in 1 + 2 = 3
```

The `type` keyword is most often used to define a type for a
struct, slice type, map type, interface, or function signature.
This avoids repeating long type definitions.

Type names must start with an uppercase letter
to make them accessible (exported) outside the current package.

The operations supported by a named type
include all those supported by the underlying type.
This means that the `score` type above can be used
in all the same ways that an `int` can be used,
but not in place of an `int`.

Methods can be added to named types.
These are described later.

### Structs

A struct is a collection of fields defined with the `struct` keyword.
Field values can have any type,
including other structs nested to any depth.
A struct cannot inherit from another struct,
but can utilize composition of structs.

Struct fields whose names start with an uppercase letter (exported) are
visible in other packages that import the package that defines the struct.
Otherwise fields are only visible in the package that defines the struct.

It is often desirable to define a type for a struct to
make it easy to refer to in variable and parameter declarations.
Otherwise the struct is anonymous and
can only be referred to where it is defined.

Here is an example of using an anonymous `struct`.

```go
me := struct{
    name string
    age int8
}{
    "Mark",
    57,
}
```

Creating a type name makes the code easier to understand
and make the `struct` definition reusable.
For example:

```go
type Person struct {
    name string
    age int8
}
```

A struct literal creates an instance of a struct.
Field values can be specified in any order by also providing corresponding keys.
For example:

```go
p1 := Person{name: "Mark", age: 57}
```

Struct fields can also be initialized by providing only values
in the order in which they are listed in the struct definition.
But this option can only be used within
the same package that defines the struct type.
It is best to only use this approach for structs with a small number of fields
because changes to the field order will break these initializations.
For example:

```go
p2 := Person{"Mark", 57}
```

Uninitialized fields are initialized to their zero value.

The dot operator is used to get and set fields within a `struct`.
For example:

```go
fmt.Println(p1.name) // Mark
p1.age++
fmt.Println(p1.age) // 58
```

There is no syntax for accessing a field of a struct
whose name is held in a variable.
However, the reflection API can be used to do this.
The standard library package `reflect`
will be covered in detail in a future article.

Here is a function that uses the `reflect` package
to get the value or a struct field
whose name can be determined at runtime.

```go
// StructFieldValue returns the value of a given field in a struct.
// The type "interface{}" means that any type can be used.
// See the "Empty Interface" section later.
func StructFieldValue(aStruct interface{}, fieldName string) reflect.Value {
    value := reflect.ValueOf(aStruct)
    if value.Kind() != reflect.Struct {
        log.Fatalf("StructFieldValue first argument must be a struct")
    }
    return value.FieldByName(fieldName)
}
```

The type `reflect.Value` has many methods for obtaining
the value as a specific built-in type. For example:

```go
// address is struct that describes a mailing address.
city := StructFieldValue(address, "city").String()
zip := StructFieldValue(address, "zip").Int()
```

The `fmt.Printf` function takes a format string that can contain "verbs".
The "%v" verb is useful during debugging for printing values of any type,
including structs.
Formatting strings are documented at <https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/>.
For example:

```go
fmt.Printf("%v\n", p2) // just field values: {Mark 58}
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", p2) // including field names: {name:Mark age:58}
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", p2) // Go-syntax representation: main.person{name:"Mark", age:58}
```

There is no support for destructuring, like in JavaScript,
to extract field values from a `struct`.

Struct fields can be accessed from a struct pointer
without dereferencing the pointer. For example:

```go
personPtr := &p1
fmt.Println((*personPtr).name) // Mark
fmt.Println(personPtr.name) // same
```

If a `struct` field name is omitted, it is assumed to be the same as the type.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    type Age int

    type myType struct {
        Name       string // named field
        Age               // gets field name from the type defined above
        time.Month        // gets field name from a library type
    }

    myStruct := myType{Name: "Mark", Age: 7, Month: time.April}
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", myStruct) // main.myType{Name:"Mark", Age:7, Month:4}
}
```

To embed a `struct` type within another,
precede the type name with a field name or
include just the type name to get a field with the same name.
The second option is referred to as an "anonymous field".
For example:

```go
type Address struct {
    Street string
    City   string
    State  string
    Zip    string
}

type Person struct {
    Name        string
    Address     // anonymous field for home address
    WorkAddress Address // named field for work address
}

me := Person{
    Name: "Mark Volkmann",
    Address: Address{
        Street: "123 Some Street",
        City:   "St. Charles",
        State:  "MO",
        Zip:    "63304", // comma is required here
    },
    WorkAddress: Address{
        Street: "123 Woodcrest Executive Drive",
        City:   "Creve Coeur",
        State:  "MO",
        Zip:    "63141", // another required comma
    },
}
```

When a nested struct is not given an explicit name, its fields
can be accessed by either using the struct name or omitting it.
For example:

```go
fmt.Println("home city is", me.Address.City) // St. Charles
fmt.Println("home city is", me.City) // same
fmt.Println("work city is", me.WorkAddress.City) // Creve Coeur; cannot omit workAddress.
```

Methods are described later.
If the type of an anonymous field has methods,
those become methods of the outer struct type as well.
For example, if the `Address` type above has a `Print` method
that prints the address in the format of a mailing label,
that method can also be called on a `Person` object.

A struct cannot contain a field whose type is the same struct type,
but it can contain a field that is a pointer to the same struct type.
For example:

```go
type Node struct {
    value int
    next *Node
}
tail := Node{value: 20}
head := Node{value: 10, next: &tail}
fmt.Println(head.value) // 10
fmt.Println(head.next.value) // 20
```

Structs can be compared using the `==` and `!=` operators
if all their field values are comparable.
Such structs can be used as keys in maps.

When a struct is passed to a function, a copy is made and
changes the function makes to its fields are not visible to the caller.
For these reasons it is common to pass pointers to structs instead of structs.

### Functions

#### Function Basics

Go functions are defined with the `func` keyword.
The syntax for named functions is:

```go
func fnName(param1 type1, param2 type2, ...) (returnTypes) {
    ...
}
```

Named functions must be declared at the package level,
not nested inside other functions.

Anonymous functions have the same syntax, but omit the name.
These can be used inside other functions.
For example, `func(v int) int { return v * 2 }`.

Both named and anonymous functions are first-class values.
This means they can be stored in variables,
passed as arguments to other functions,
and returned from other functions.
For example, `double := func(v int) int { return v * 2 }`.

When a function is assigned to variable,
it can be called using that variable.
For example, `fn := someFunction; fn()`.

If a variable with a function type is not assigned a value,
it defaults to nil.
If a call is made on a nil variable, a panic is triggered.

Function arguments are passed by value
so copies are made of arrays, slices, and structs.
To avoid creating copies of these and enable the function
to make changes that are visible to the caller,
pass and accept pointers.

#### Function Parameters

Function parameters are local variables inside the function.

Functions cannot be overloaded based on their parameter types
in order to create different implementations.

When consecutive parameters have the same type,
the type can be omitted from all but the last.
For example, `func foo(p1 int, p2 int, p3 string, p4 string)`
is is equivalent to `func foo(p1, p2 int, p3, p4 string)`.

It is not possible to specify default values for function parameters
and they cannot be made optional.
However, functions can accept a variable number of arguments.
These are referred to as variadic functions.

#### Variadic Functions

To define a variadic function, precede the type
of the last named parameter with an ellipsis.
When the function is called, behind the scenes
an array is created to hold all the arguments after the initial ones
and the last parameter is set to a slice over that array.
For example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

// The type "interface{}" means that any type can be used.
// See the "Empty Interface" section later.
func log(args ...interface{}) {
    fmt.Println(args...)
}

// This accepts a person's name followed by
// any number of color names.
func report(name string, colors ...string) {
    text := strings.Join(colors, " and ")
    fmt.Printf("%s likes the colors %s.\n", name, text)
}

func main() {
    log("red", 7, true) // red 7 true
    report("Mark", "yellow", "orange") // Mark likes the colors yellow and orange.
}
```

If the values to be passed to a variadic function
are already in a variable that holds a slice,
follow the variable name with an ellipsis
to pass the values as separate arguments.
If they are in an array, first create a slice over it.
For example, the following can be added
to the end of the `main` function above:

```go
    // This must match the parameter type of the log function
    // rather than be a slice of strings.
    args := []interface{}{"red", 7, true}
    log(args...)

    // The initial arguments before the variadic one
    // must be passed separately.
    colors := []string{"yellow", "orange"}
    report("Mark", colors...)
```

#### Function Return Values

Functions can return zero or more values.
When there are no return values, the list of return types is omitted.
When there is one return value, its type is provided,
but parentheses around it are optional and typically omitted.
When there are multiple return values, the types
must be surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas.

When calling a function, all return values
must be captured in variables.
The blank identifier `_` can be
used to capture unneeded return values.

For example:

```go
// This takes a "slice" of int values and returns
// their sum as an int and their average as a float64.
func GetStats(numbers []int) (int, float64) {
    sum := 0
    for _, number := range numbers {
        sum += number
    }
    average := float64(sum) / float64(len(numbers))
    return sum, average
}

// In some other function
scores := []int{1, 3, 4, 7}
sum, avg := GetStats(scores)
// Do something with sum and avg.
```

A common use of returning multiple values from a function is to
return a result and a value that either describes an error or
is a boolean that indicates whether the function was successful.
Using a boolean is preferred when
there is only one way the function can fail.

For example, the `ReadFile` function
in the `io/ioutil` standard library package
takes a file path and returns
a byte array and an error description.

```go
bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile("haiku.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
// Do something with bytes.
```

For details on error handling,
see the "Error Handling" section later.

A function call can appear as the only argument
in another function call. The return values
become the actual arguments to the outer call.
For example:

```go
// Pass the two return values from GetStats to Println.
fmt.Println(GetStats(scores));
```

Function return types can have associated names
that become local variables inside the function.
This enables "naked" (a.k.a. "bare") returns where
a `return` with no specified values will return
the values of variables with the given names.
For example:

```go
func mult(n int) (times2, times3 int) {
    times2 = n * 2
    times3 = n * 3
    //return times2 times3 // don't need to specify return values
    return
}

// In some other function
n2, n3 := mult(3) // n2 is 6 and n3 is 9
```

Unless the function is very short, using naked returns is frowned upon
because the code is less readable than explicitly returning values.

#### Function Types

Functions have a type that is defined by their signature.
This is based on the order and type of the parameters
and the order of the return types.
The function name, parameter names,
and any return value names
are not part of the signature.

Function types can be important when passing functions to
or returning functions from another function.

It is sometimes useful to define a type for a function signature
to avoid repeating a long definition.
For example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// This type matches any function that
// takes two float64 arguments and returns a float64.
type CalculateFn func(float64, float64) float64

func product(a float64, b float64) float64 {
    return a * b
}

// This function takes a function as its third argument.
func process(m float64, n float64, fn CalculateFn) float64 {
    return fn(m, n)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("result =", process(2, 3, product)) // 6
}
```

#### Recursion

Like most programming languages, functions in Go can be recursive.

Most languages use a fixed-size stack
that limits the depth of recursive calls.
Generally programs crash when they exceed this.

Go uses a variable-size stack that grows as needed.
This allows Go functions to support a higher recursive depth
than most languages without crashing.

The maximum stack size for 64-bit systems is 1GB by default.
This can be modified by calling the `SetMaxStack` function
in the `runtime/debug` standard library package.

#### Closures

Functions act as closures over all in-scope variables.
This allows nested, anonymous functions
to retain access to and modify variables
that are in the scope of their definition.

Typically the lifetime of a variable declared inside
a function is the duration of a call to that function.
However, the fact that functions are closures
creates an exception to this. For example:

```go
func closureDemo() func() {
    // The lifetime of this variable is the lifetime
    // of the function returned by this function.
    secret := "Don't tell!"
    return func () {
        fmt.Println(secret); // captures local variable secret
    }
}

func main() {
    fn := closureDemo();
    fn(); // Don't tell!
}
```

### Methods

#### Method Basics

Methods are functions that are invoked on a "receiver" value.
They can be associated with any named type
that is not a pointer or interface.
The receiver is an instance of this type.
Methods cannot be associated with built-in types.

Methods are particularly useful for types that implement interfaces.
Otherwise we can just write functions
that take a value of the type as an argument.

One benefit of defining a method on a type instead of
defining a function that takes an argument of the type
is that the name can be shorter without losing meaning.
For example, we can add a `getAge` method to a `Person` type
or we can define a `getPersonAge` function that takes a `Person`.
The difference is even more significant for calls made from
another package because in that case function names must be
prefixed with the package name whereas method names do not.

Just like functions, methods whose name starts with a lowercase letter
can only be called by code in package where the method is defined.
To make them available in other packages,
their names must start with an uppercase letter.

The syntax for defining a method is
`func (receiver-info) name(parameter-list) (return-types) { body }`.

Note that there are three pairs of parentheses.
If the method has no return type,
or it has only one and it is unnamed,
the last pair of parentheses can be omitted.

In most programming languages that support methods,
the method body refers to the receiver
using a keyword like `this` or `self`.
In Go the method signature specifies the name
by which the receiver will be referenced.

`receiver-info` is a name followed by the instance type for the method.
Often the receiver name is the lowercase first letter of its type.
For example, if the receiver type is `Person` then the receiver name is `p`.

#### Method Restrictions

Methods must defined in a source file for the same package
that defines their receiver type.

If an attempt is made to add a method to a built-in type
an error with the message "cannot define new methods on non-local type"
will be triggered.

When a type has multiple methods, the `golint` tool
wants all the receivers to have the same name.

It is not possible to create overloaded methods on a type
to create different implementations for different parameter types.
Methods are distinguished only by the receiver type and their name.

#### Method Example

The following code adds a method to the Person type.
Note how the receiver and its type appear
in parentheses before the method name.

```go
func (p *Person) Birthday() {
    p.age++
}
```

To call a method, specify the receiver, followed by a dot,
the method name, and the argument list. For example:

```go
p := Person{name: "Mark", age: 57}
(&p).Birthday() // The method can be invoked on a pointer to a Person.
p.Birthday() // It can also be invoked on a Person.
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", p) // main.Person{name:"Mark", age:59}
```

In the previous example the receiver is a pointer to a struct.
This allows the method to modify the struct
and avoids making a copy of the struct when it is invoked.
When the receiver is a type value and not a pointer to a type value
the method receives a copy and cannot modify the original.

#### Method Definition Location

It may seem that struct methods should be defined inside the struct.
However, the ability to define methods outside the type definition
is required in order to add methods to non-struct types.
So Go chooses to only support this approach for all types.

#### Methods With Pointer Receivers

When a function has a parameter with a pointer type,
it must be passed a pointer.
However, when a method has a pointer receiver,
it can be invoked on a pointer to a value or a value.
When invoked on a value, it will automatically
use a pointer to the value as the receiver.

Go convention is that if any method for a type
has a pointer receiver, all of them should.
However, `golint` does not complain if this convention is violated.

Methods that have a pointer receiver can
choose to handle `nil` as a receiver value.
For example, a method that operates on a linked list
and expects the receiver to be a pointer to the head
can check for nil and return some reasonable value.

#### Methods On Primitive Types

Recall that the underlying type of a named type can be a primitive type.
Here is an example of adding a method to a
named type with an underlying type of `int`.

```go
type Number int

func (receiver Number) Double() Number {
    return receiver * 2
}

n := Number(3) // or could use var n Number = 3
fmt.Println(n.Double()) // 6
```

#### Struct Method Promotion

When a struct type A is embedded in another struct type B,
methods on A can be called on B.
This works because the methods from type A are promoted to type B.
However, this does not mean that values of type B
can be used anywhere values of type A can be used.
A and B are still distinct types and there is no implied type hierarchy.

#### Ambiguous Selectors

If all of the following occur,
an "ambiguous selector" error is triggered at compile-time.

1. Multiple struct types are embedded in another struct A.
2. More than one of the embedded struct types has a method B.
3. An instance of A is created.
4. A call to method B on this instance is made.

An example of this follows:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Foo struct {
}

func (f Foo) DoIt() {
    fmt.Println("Foo: DoIt entered")
}

type Bar struct {
}

func (b Bar) DoIt() {
    fmt.Println("Bar: DoIt entered")
}

// This struct embeds the two previous structs.
type Baz struct {
    Foo
    Bar
}

func main() {
    myBaz := Baz{}
    myBaz.DoIt() // ambiguous selector
}
```

#### Method Values

A method call combines selecting a method on the receiver type
and binding it to the receiver.
When the parentheses and arguments are omitted,
the expression evaluates to a function that
represents the method bound to the receiver.
This function is called a "method value" and
can be called later with arguments.

For example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

type Point struct {
    x float64
    y float64
}

// Distance returns the distance from
// the receiver point to a given Point.
func (p Point) Distance(p2 Point) float64 {
    return math.Sqrt(math.Pow(p.x - p2.x, 2) + math.Pow(p.y - p2.y, 2))
}

func main() {
    p1 := Point{1, 2}
    p2 := Point{4, 6}

    // Normal call
    fmt.Println(p1.Distance(p2)) // 5

    // Obtain a method value and call it.
    distanceFromP1 := p1.Distance
    fmt.Println(distanceFromP1(p2)) // 5
}
```

#### Method Expressions

A "method expression" is a type name is followed by a dot and a method name.
This evaluates to a function whose
first argument is treated as the method receiver and
remaining arguments are treated as the method arguments.
For example:

```go
    // Obtain a method expression can call it.
    distanceBetweenPoints := Point.Distance
    fmt.Println(distanceBetweenPoints(p1, p2)) // 5
```

#### Struct Field Encapsulation

Access to struct fields can be encapsulated
by using names that start with a lowercase letter
and adding methods that operate on the fields.

Encapsulation has many benefits.
It prevents code that uses the fields from relying
on implementation details that may change later.
It can prevent code that uses the fields from setting field values incorrectly.
It reduces the amount of code that must be examined
to determine where a value is being set incorrectly.

Encapsulation is overkill in many cases.
It should be avoided when
the type of a field is unlikely to change,
using code is unlikely to set it to invalid values, and
non-setter/getter methods directly set and get the field.

Go has a naming convention for methods that get and set data.
"Setter" method names start with "Set", but
"getter" method names typically do not start with "Get".
For example, methods to set and get the birthday of a person
might be named `SetBirthday` and `Birthday`.

Suppose we want to encapsulate access to
the birthday of a person and use it to
calculate their age based on the current date.

The package `encapsulation` below defines a `Person` type
and exports a `NewPerson` function that creates a `Person` object.
It also adds methods to the `Person` type to get their age,
birthday as a `time.Time` object, and formatted birthday string.

```go
package encapsulation

import (
    "time"
)

// The "reference time" for time format strings
// is "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006".
// Format strings are built using these specific values
// and variations on them.
// For more detail, see the comments at https://golang.org/src/time/format.go.
// The following is a date format string that is passed to the Time Format method.
const dateFormat = "January 2, 2006"

// Person describes a person.
type Person struct {
    Name     string    // exported
    birthday time.Time // encapsulated
}

// NewPerson creates and returns a new Person object.
// This is needed because the birthday field is not exported.
// If it were exported, code in other packages could
// directly create Person objects.
func NewPerson(name string, birthday time.Time) Person {
    return Person{name, birthday}
}

// Age calculates and returns the age of a Person.
func (p *Person) Age() int {
    todayY, todayM, todayD := time.Now().Date()
    birthdayY, birthdayM, birthdayD := p.birthday.Date()
    age := todayY - birthdayY
    // Subtract one if the birthday has not occurred yet this year.
    if todayM < birthdayM || (todayM == birthdayM && todayD < birthdayD) {
        age--
    }
    return age
}

// Birthday returns the value of the encapsulated field birthday.
func (p *Person) Birthday() time.Time {
    return p.birthday
}

// FormattedBirthday returns the formatted birthday of a Person.
func (p *Person) FormattedBirthday() string {
    return p.birthday.Format(dateFormat)
}
```

Here is an application that uses the `encapsulation` package.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/mvolkmann/encapsulation"
)

func main() {
    birthday := time.Date(1961, time.April, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
    me := encapsulation.NewPerson("Mark", birthday)
    fmt.Printf("%s was born on %s.\n", me.Name, me.FormattedBirthday())
    fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", me.Name, me.Age())
}
```

### Arrays

Arrays hold an ordered collection of values,
also known as elements, that all have the same type.

Values can be other arrays to create multidimensional arrays.

Arrays have a fixed length and the length is part of their type.

In some languages `string[]` represents an array of strings.
In a GraphQL schema, this would be written as `[string]`.
But Go chooses a third option, `[]string`
which was inspired by Algol 68.

The syntax for declaring an array is `[length]type`.
The length must be a compile-time expression.
For example, `var rgb [3]int`.

An array can be created with an "array literal".
This uses curly braces to specify initial elements.
For example, `rgb := [5]int{100, 50, 234}`.
This creates an array with a length of five
where only the first three elements are explicitly initialized.
The remaining elements are initialized to their zero value.

To create an array whose length is
the same as the number of supplied initial values,
place an ellipsis inside the square brackets
instead of a length.
For example, `rgb := [...]int{100, 50, 234}`.
This creates an array with a length of three.

An array can be created by specifying values at specific indexes.
Values at unspecified indexes are given the zero value for the array element type.
For example, `names := [...]string{3: "Mark", 1: "Tami"}`
creates the array `["", "Tami", "", "Mark"]`.
The length is one more than the highest specified index.

If anything other than a single integer or ellipsis appears inside the
square brackets, a "slice" is created.
Slices are discussed in the next section.

Square brackets are also used to get and set
the value at a zero-based index.
To get the second element, `rgb[1]`.
To set the second element, `rgb[1] = 75`.
Attempting to get or set an element at an index beyond the end
triggers a panic.

To get the length of an array, `len(myArr)`.

For arrays, the capacity is the same as the length,
so `cap(myArr)` returns the same value.
We will see that this is not the case for slices.

One way to iterate over the elements of an array
is to use a C-style `for` loop.
For example:

```go
for index := 0; index < len(myArr); index++ {
    value := myArr[index]
    // Do something with value.
}
```

The `range` keyword can be also used to iterate over the elements,
and this is preferred. For example:

```go
for index, value := range myArr {
    // Do something with value, and possibly index.
}
```

If `index` is not needed, the blank identifier `_` can be used in its place.

```go
for _, value := range myArr {
    // Do something with value.
}
```

When an array is passed as an argument to a function,
a copy of the array is created.
Changes the function makes to the array elements
are not visible to the caller.
To avoid copying and allow the caller to see changes,
write functions to accept a pointer to an array rather than an array
and pass pointers.

### Slices

Slices are a distinct type from arrays.
They are a variable length view into an array that has a fixed length.

Functions that take a slice parameter cannot be passed an array.
Many functions prefer slices over arrays.
Unless having a fixed length is important,
use a slice instead of an array.

A slice is described by three components, a pointer to an array element,
a current length, and a current capacity.
The pointer can point to any element in the array.
The length is number of array elements currently seen by the slice.
The capacity is the number of array elements
from the pointer to the end of the array.
For example:

```go
arr := [...]string{"red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"}
sl := arr[2:5]
```

The slice `sl` currently points to the element "yellow" in `arr`
because that is the element at index 2.
It has a length of 3 (5 - 2) and
can access the elements "yellow", "green", and "blue".
It has a capacity of 4 because there is one more element in the array,
"purple", that it cannot currently see.

A slice type is declared with nothing inside square brackets.
For example, `[]int` is a slice of int values
that is not yet associated with an array.

There are three ways to create a slice.

1. using a "slice literal"
2. using the built-in `make` function
3. basing on an existing array

The most common way to create a slice is with a slice literal
which creates a slice and its underlying array.
These look like an array literals, but without a specified length.
`mySlice := []int{}` creates a slice with an empty underlying array
where the length and capacity are 0.
`mySlice := []int{2, 4, 6}` creates a slice where the
length and capacity are 3, and contains the provided initial values.

It is also possible, but not common, to specify values at specific indexes.
`mySlice := []int{2: 6, 1: 4, 0: 2}` is the same as the previous example.
`mySlice := []int{3: 7, 0: 2}` creates a slice where the length and capacity
are 4 which is one more than the highest specified index.

The `make` function provides another way
to create a slice and underlying array.
Rather than specifying initial values,
the length and capacity are specified.
This can avoid reallocating space if elements are appended later,
which is somewhat inefficient.
If it is anticipated that many elements will be appended later,
try to estimate the largest size needed
and use `make` to create the slice.
For example, `mySlice := make([]int, 5)`
creates an underlying array of size 5
and a slice with length 5 and capacity of 5.
`mySlice := make([]int, 0, 5)`
creates an underlying array of size 5 and
a slice with length 0 and capacity of 5.

The final and least commonly used way to
create a slice is to base it on an existing array,
specifying the start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indexes.
For example, `mySlice := myArr[start:end]`
If `start` is omitted, it defaults to 0.
If `end` is omitted, it defaults to the array length.
So `myArr[:]` creates a slice over the entire array.

Modifying elements of a slice modifies the underlying array.

Multiple slices on the same array see the same data.
Utilizing this feature can be a common source errors
since changing elements in one slice affects others.

The built-in `append` function takes a slice
and returns a new slice containing additional elements.
For example, `mySlice = append(mySlice, 8, 10)`
appends the values 8 and 10.
If the underlying array is too small to accommodate the new elements,
a larger array is automatically allocated
(doubling the current capacity after the length exceeds 4)
and the returned slice will refer to it.
It is not possible to append elements to arrays,
which is one reason why slices are often preferred.

`len(mySlice)` returns the number of elements in the slice
which is its current length.

`cap(mySlice)` returns the number of elements from the
start index of the slice to the end of underlying array
which is its current capacity.

Just like arrays, square brackets are used to
get and set the value of a slice at a zero-based index.
If the index is greater than or equal to the slice capacity,
a panic will be triggered with the message
"runtime error: index out of range".

The same approaches for iterating over the elements of an array
can be used to iterate over the elements of a slice.

To change the view of a slice into its underlying array,
recreate it with different bounds
For example, `mySlice = mySlice[newStart:newEnd]`.
This creates a slice that begins at `newStart`
and ends just before `newEnd`.

Slice elements can be other slices to create multidimensional slices.
For example:

```go
ticTacToe := [][]string{
    []string{" ", " ", " "},
    []string{" ", " ", " "},
    []string{" ", " ", " "}}
    // If the last } is placed on a new line then a
    // comma is required at the end of the previous line.
}
ticTacToe[1][2] = "X"
```

To use all the elements in a slice as separate arguments to a function
follow the variable name holding the slice with an ellipsis.
For example:

```go
// This is a "variadic function" that
// takes any number of int arguments.
func sum(numbers ...int) int {
    result := 0
    for _, number := range numbers {
        result += number
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(sum(1, 2, 3)) // 6
    values := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println(sum(values...)) // 6
}
```

Slices can contain values of any type.
Here is an example that uses a slice of structs:

```go
type Person struct {
    name string
    age  int8
}

func main() {
    // Note how we do not need to precede each struct with "Person".
    people := []Person{{"Mark", 57}, {"Jeremy", 31}}
    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", people) // [{name:Mark age:57} {name:Jeremy age:31}]
}
```

A slice can be used to implement a stack.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// IntStack is a stack of int values.
type IntStack []int

// Push adds an int to the end of the stack.
func (s *IntStack) Push(value int) {
    *s = append(*s, value)
}

// Pop removes an int to the end of the stack and returns it.
func (s *IntStack) Pop() int {
    stack := *s
    l := len(stack)
    top := stack[l-1]
    *s = stack[:l-1]
    return top
}

func main() {
    myStack := IntStack{1, 3, 5}
    fmt.Println(myStack.Pop())             // 5, now contains [1, 3]
    fmt.Println(myStack.Pop())             // 3, now contains [1]
    myStack.Push(7)                        // now contains [1, 7]
    myStack.Push(9)                        // now contains [1, 7, 9]
    fmt.Printf("myStack = %+v\n", myStack) // [1 7 9]
}
```

### Maps

A map is a collection of key/value pairs
that provides efficient lookup of values by their key.
The keys and values can have any type, but
in a given map all the keys have the same type
and all the values have the same type.

The syntax for a map type is `map[keyType]valueType`.
For example, `var myMap map[string]int`.

A named type can be created for this type which is
useful when it will be referred to in many places.
For example, `type PlayerScoreMap map[string]int`.

One way to create a map is with a "map literal"
which allows specifying initial key/value pairs.
For example,
`scoreMap := map[string]int{"Mark": 90, "Tami": 92}`,
or using the named type above,
`scoreMap := PlayerScoreMap{"Mark": 90, "Tami": 92}`.

Another way to create a map is to use the built-in `make` function.
For example, `scoreMap := make(map[string]int)`
or `scoreMap := make(PlayerScoreMap)`.

To add a key/value pair, `myMap[key] = value`.

To get the value for a given key, `value := myMap[key]`.
If the key is not present,
the zero value for the value type is returned.

For example:

```go
type PlayerScoreMap map[string]int

scoreMap := PlayerScoreMap{"Mark": 90, "Tami": 92}
scoreMap["Amanda"] = 83
scoreMap["Jeremy"] = 95

myScore := scoreMap["Mark"]
fmt.Println("my score =", myScore) // 90
fmt.Printf("scoreMap = %+v\n", scoreMap) // map[Tami:92 Amanda:83 Jeremy:95 Mark:90]
```

To get the value for a given key and verify that the key was present,
as opposed to getting the zero value because it isn't,
capture the second return value which is a `bool`. For example:

```go
value, found := myMap[key]
if found {
    // Do something with value.
}
```

or

```go
if value, found := myMap[key]; found {
    // Do something with value.
}
```

In maps where the values are numbers,
the `++`, `--`, and arithmetic assignment operators
can be used to modify values.
For example, `scoreMap["Mark"]++` and `scoreMap["Tami"] *= 2`.

To delete a key/value pair, `delete(myMap, key)`.

To iterate over the key/value pairs in a map,
`for key, value := range myMap { ... }`.
The order of iteration is not defined.

Maps support concurrent reads, but not concurrent writes
or a concurrent read and write.
If a map might be accessed concurrently from multiple goroutines,
protect against this by using channels or mutexes.
These will be described in the Concurrency article later in the series.

### Sets

Go does not have a built-in data structure for representing sets
which are unordered collections of unique values.
However, a `Map` that uses `bool` values or
empty structs for values can be used for this purpose.

Unlike `bool` values, empty structs do not take up memory.
They are written as `struct{}`.

The following simple package defines a set data structure for strings.

```go
package set

type empty struct{} // memory-efficient value for sets

// Strings is a set of strings.
type Strings map[string]empty

// This value is used to mark a value as present in the set.
var present = empty{}

// Add adds a given value to the set.
func (set Strings) Add(value string) {
    set[value] = present
}

// Contains determines if a given value is in the set.
func (set Strings) Contains(value string) bool {
    _, ok := set[value]
    return ok
}

// Remove removes a given value from the set.
func (set Strings) Remove(value string) {
    delete(set, value)
}
```

Here's an example of using this "set" package.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/mvolkmann/set"
)

func main() {
    colorSet := set.Strings{}
    colorSet.Add("red")
    colorSet.Add("yellow")
    colorSet.Add("blue")
    colorSet.Remove("yellow")

    colors := []string{"red", "yellow", "blue"}
    for _, color := range colors {
        if colorSet.Contains(color) {
            fmt.Println("have", color) // prints "have red" and "have blue"
        }
    }

    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", colorSet) // map[red:{} yellow:{}]
    fmt.Println(len(colorSet)) // 2
}
```

A recommended community library that supports many data structures
is "gods" at <https://github.com/emirpasic/gods>.
It implements several kinds of lists, sets, stacks, maps, and trees.
These collections can hold values of any type,
but using the values typically requires "type assertions"
(described later).

Here is an example of using the `gods.HashSet` type
to represent a set of `int` values.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/emirpasic/gods/sets/hashset"
)

func main() {
    set := hashset.New()   // empty
    set.Add(1)             // 1
    set.Add(2, 2, 3, 4, 5) // 3, 1, 2, 4, 5 (random order, duplicates ignored)
    set.Remove(4)          // 5, 3, 2, 1
    set.Remove(2, 3)       // 1, 5

    fmt.Println("contains 1?", set.Contains(1))          // true
    fmt.Println("contains 1 and 5?", set.Contains(1, 5)) // true
    fmt.Println("contains 1 and 6?", set.Contains(1, 6)) // false

    values := set.Values()
    fmt.Println("values =", values)    // []int{5,1} (random order)
    fmt.Println("empty?", set.Empty()) // false
    fmt.Println("size =", set.Size())  // 2

    // Must use type assertions to operate on values.
    sum := 0
    for _, v := range values {
        sum += v.(int)
    }
    fmt.Println("sum =", sum) // 6

    set.Clear()                        // empty
    fmt.Println("empty?", set.Empty()) // true
    fmt.Println("size =", set.Size())  // 0
}
```

### Deferred Functions

Inside a function, function calls preceded by `defer`
have their arguments evaluated immediately,
but the function does not execute until the containing function exits.

All deferred calls are placed on a stack and
executed in the reverse order from which they are evaluated.

A deferred function can change the values returned
by a function by simply returning other values.

Deferred functions are typically used for resource cleanup
that must occur regardless of the code path taken in the function.
Examples include closing files, closing network connections,
unlocking mutexes, and logging function results/exits.

This is an alternative to the `try`/`finally` syntax
found in other languages.

Here is an example of using `defer` to
log how long it takes for a function to execute:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"
)

// Note that this returns a function.
func startTimer(name string) func() {
    t := time.Now()
    return func() {
        delta := time.Now().Sub(t)
        log.Println(name, "took", delta)
    }
}

func doWork() int {
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < 100000000; i++ {
        sum += i
    }
    return sum
}

func main() {
    // Note that the syntax appears to call
    // the function returned by startTime immediately,
    // but it is not actually run until the main function exits.
    defer startTimer("doWork")()
    fmt.Println(doWork())
}
```

### Interfaces

#### Interface Basics

An interface defines a set of methods to be implemented by types.
Any named type can implement an interface,
even those whose underlying type is a primitive type.

A type can implement any number of interfaces.

Types do not state the interfaces they implement.
They only need to implement all the methods
of the interfaces they wish to implement.

Interface types are abstract, meaning that
it is not possible to directly create instances of them.
Instead, instances of types that implement an interface are created.

Variables and parameters with an interface type can hold any value
whose type implements all the methods of the interface.
When a value is assigned to such variables or passed to such parameters,
if the actual type does not implement all the interface methods,
a compile-time error is reported that identifies one of the missing methods.

The actual value of a variable or parameter with an interface type
may support additional methods, but those cannot be called without
using a type assertion which is described later.

Calling a method on a variable with an interface type
calls the method on the underlying type.
If a value has not be assigned to the variable,
meaning it is `nil`,
calling a method on it triggers a panic.

An interface is typically only used when
more than one concrete type will implement it and
there is a need to use values of the interface type
in a way that works for all the concrete types.

#### Interface Example

In the example below, the interface type `Shape`
is implemented by the concrete types `Rectangle` and `Circle`.
This allows writing code that works with variables
of type `Shape` without needing to know the concrete type.

```go
package main
import "fmt"
import "math"

type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
    Name() string
}

type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}
func (r Rectangle) Name() string {
    return "rectangle"
}

type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}
func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c Circle) Name() string {
    return "circle"
}
// Adding a method to the Circle type that is not in the Shape interface.
func (c Circle) Diameter() float64 {
    return c.radius * 2
}

func printArea(g Shape) {
    fmt.Println("area =", g.Area())
}

func main() {
    r := Rectangle{width: 3, height: 4}
    c := Circle{radius: 5}
    var g Shape // g has an interface type and is not initialized.
    //printArea(g) // panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
    g = r
    // The formatting verb %T outputs the type of the value
    // currently held in an interface variable.
    fmt.Printf("g currently holds a %T\n", g) // main.rectangle
    printArea(g) // area = 12
    g = c
    printArea(g) // area = 78.53981633974483

    // Since the shape interface doesn't define the diameter method,
    // a type assertion is required to call it.
    fmt.Println("diameter =", g.(Circle).Diameter()) // diameter = 10
}
```

#### Compile Time Checks

A variable declaration can specify that the assigned value
on the right must implement a given interface.
This is checked at compile-time. For example:

```go
r := Rectangle{width: 3, height: 4} // no check performed
var r Shape = Rectangle{width: 3, height: 4} // passes
var r io.Reader = Rectangle{width: 3, height: 4} // fails with "does not implement"
```

#### Empty Interface

An interface with no methods, referred to as
the "empty interface", matches every type.
This includes pointers to specific types.
It is written as `interface{}`.

The empty interface enables writing functions
with parameters that accept any type.
The standard library package `fmt` defines many functions
such as `Println` and `Printf` that do this.

Think of using the `interface{}` type as opting into runtime type checking
which introduces more opportunities for panics to occur.

To make this more clear, we could define
the type `any` with `type any interface{}`.
However, `any` would be a distinct type,
not just an alias for `interface{}`.
So it's best to just use `interface{}`
when any type should be accepted.

To accept a pointer to any type, use `interface{}`,
not `*interface{}`.

Type assertions must be used to operate on these values.
These are described in the next section.

Using empty interfaces should be avoided when possible
because they sacrifice compile-time type checking
and open the possibility for more run-time errors.

#### Type Assertions

A "type assertion" verifies that the value of
an interface variable refers to a specific type.
If it does, the same value is returned, but with the asserted type.
If it does not, a panic is triggered.

For example, consider `myShape := g.(Circle)`.
The asserted type `Circle` is a concrete type.
If `g` does refer to a `Circle`
then the type of `myShape` is `Circle`.

When the asserted type is an interface type,
if the value of the variable implements the interface
then the result has that interface type.
This can be used to allow methods from the asserted interface to be called.
For example, suppose we have a value in the variable `someValue`
whose type implements multiple interfaces, one of which is `Shape`.
The following code prints the name of the shape.

```go
myShape := someValue.(Shape);
fmt.Println(myShape.Name)
```

Keep in mind that when running a program using `go run`,
if there are compile errors, no type-assertion panics
will not be triggered because the code won't begin running.

#### Type Tests

A "type test" determines whether an interface variable
refers to a specific type.
It differs from a type assertion in that
an extra return value is captured and it does not panic
if the value being tested does not match the asserted type.

For example, consider `myShape, ok := g.(Circle)`.
The variable `ok` will be set to `true` or `false`
to indicate whether `g` refers to a `Circle` object.

Type assertions and type tests can be used with any type,
even primitive types. For example,
a function that has a parameter of type `interface{}`
can test the actual type as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "strconv"
)

func makeString(value interface{}) string {
    if b, ok := value.(bool); ok {
        if b {
            return "true"
        }
        return "false"
    } else if i, ok := value.(int); ok {
        return strconv.Itoa(i) // converts an int to a string
    } else if _, ok := value.(float64); ok {
        return fmt.Sprintf("%f", value)
    } else if s, ok := value.(string); ok {
        return s
    } else {
        log.Fatalf("unsupported value %v of type %T", value, value)
        return "" // won't reach, but compiler wants this
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(makeString(false))
    fmt.Println(makeString(true))
    fmt.Println(makeString(7))
    fmt.Println(makeString(3.14))
    fmt.Println(makeString("test"))
    fmt.Println(makeString('x')) // unsupported value 120 of type int32
}
```

A nicer way to write the `makeString` function
is to use a "type switch" as follows:

```go
func makeString(value interface{}) string {
    // Note how the variable "value" is shadowed
    // with the result of the type assertion.
    switch value := value.(type) {
    case bool:
        if value {
            return "true"
        }
        return "false"
    case int:
        return strconv.Itoa(value)
    case float64:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%f", value)
    case string:
        return value
    default:
        log.Fatalf("unsupported value %v of type %T", value, value)
        return ""
    }
}
```

#### Linked List Example

Here is an example of a custom collection that
can hold values of any type. It is a basic linked list.
Note how type assertions are required to
use values that are obtained from the collection.

For a doubly linked list, see the
standard library package `container/list`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// LinkedList implements a linked list with values of any type.
type LinkedList struct {
    head *node
}

type node struct {
    value interface{}
    next  *node
}

// Clear removes all nodes.
func (listPtr *LinkedList) Clear() {
    listPtr.head = nil
}

// IsEmpty determines if the LinkedList is empty.
func (listPtr *LinkedList) IsEmpty() bool {
    return listPtr.head == nil
}

// Pop removes the first node and returns its value.
func (listPtr *LinkedList) Pop() interface{} {
    if listPtr.IsEmpty() {
        return nil
    }
    node := listPtr.head
    listPtr.head = node.next
    return node.value
}

// Push adds a node to the front.
func (listPtr *LinkedList) Push(value interface{}) {
    node := node{value, listPtr.head}
    listPtr.head = &node
}

// Len returns the length of the LinkedList.
func (listPtr *LinkedList) Len() int {
    len := 0
    node := listPtr.head
    for node != nil {
        len++
        node = node.next
    }
    return len
}

func main() {
    list := LinkedList{}
    list.Push(1)
    list.Push(3)
    list.Clear()
    list.Push(5)
    list.Push(7)

    sum := 0
    for !list.IsEmpty() {
        value := list.Pop()
        fmt.Println("value =", value) // 7 and 5
        sum += value.(int)
    }
    fmt.Println("sum =", sum) // 12
}
```

#### Standard Library Interfaces

The standard library packages define many interfaces.
For example, the `fmt` package defines the `Stringer` interface.
It contains one method named `String`.
Functions in many other packages check whether values
implement this interface in order to convert values to strings.

Any type can choose to implement this interface
by defining the `String` method.
For example:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age int8
}

// Note that the receiver is a Person struct, not a pointer to one.
func (p Person) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%v is %v years old.", p.Name, p.Age)
}

me := Person{"Mark", 57}
fmt.Println(me) // Mark is 57 years old.
```

Examples of other commonly used interfaces defined in the standard library
include `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`.
Implementations of these interfaces read from and write to many things
including files, network connections, in-memory buffers, and more.

The `io.Reader` interface defines a `Read` method that
takes a byte slice to hold the data read.
It returns the number of bytes read and an error description.

The `io.Writer` interface defines a `Write` method that
takes a byte slice containing the data to be written.
It returns the number of bytes written and an error description.

#### Nested Interfaces

Interfaces can be nested to add the methods of one interface to another.
For example:

```go
package main

type Shape2d interface {
    area() float64
}

type Shape3d interface {
    Shape2d // Shape3d objects also support Shape2d methods
    volume() float64
}

type Box struct {
    d float64
    h float64
    w float64
}

// Implements Shape2d interface.
// Accepting a pointer so a copy is not made.
func (b *Box) area() float64 {
    return b.w * b.h
}

// Implements Shape3d interface.
func (b *Box) volume() float64 {
    return b.area() * b.d
}

func main() {
    myBox := Box{d: 2, h: 3, w: 4}
    fmt.Println("area =", myBox.area()) // 12
    fmt.Println("volume =", myBox.volume()) // 24
}
```

### Error Handling

Go does not support exceptions and thus
has no `try`, `catch`, or `finally` keywords.
Instead functions that may encounter errors have
an additional return value of type `error`
that callers should check.
When there is no error, this return value is `nil`.

The type `error` is a built-in interface with a
single method `Error` that takes no arguments and
returns a `string` description of the error.

Go prefers this error handling approach
over using exceptions.
One reason is that it requires
handling errors as they occur
rather than grouping a happy path of statements
in a try block and handling errors
with catch blocks at the end.
Another reason is that exception handling typically
allows a program to terminate with a stack trace
when an unhandled error occurs.

The standard library creates and exports
many instances of this interface.
It is also possible to define
custom implementations of the `error` interface
that hold additional data describing the error.

#### Creating Error Values

The `errors` package defines a `New` function
that creates error instances from a string.
For example:

```go
package main
import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

func divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("divide by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil // no error
}

func main() {
    q, err := divide(7, 0)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(q)
}
```

Another way to create an `error` value is to use the `fmt.Errorf` function.
It works like `fmt.Sprintf` to format an error message.
The line in the `divide` function above that creates and returns an `error`
can be replaced by `return 0, fmt.Errorf("divide %d by zero", a)`.
This differs in that the error message includes
the number that would have been divided by zero.

When an error is returned, typically the other return values
are not be expected to be usable values.

#### Custom Error Types

Sometimes it is useful for an error
to hold more data than just a message.
This allows callers of functions that return errors
to access additional details.

Here is an example of defining a custom error type, `DivideByZero`,
that holds an error message and the numerator value.

```go
type DivideByZero struct {
    numerator float64
}

// This makes the DivideByZero type implement the error interface.
func (err DivideByZero) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("tried to divide %f by zero", err.numerator)
}

func divide2(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, DivideByZero{a}
    }
    return a / b, nil // no error
}
```

It is a convention in Go to handle error conditions before success.
This allows "mainline code" that follows to appear un-indented.
For example, instead of:

```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err == nil {
    // Do something with result.
} else {
    // Handle errors
}
```

the following is preferred:

```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    // Handle errors
    return
}
// Do something with result.
```

#### Panics

A panic is a runtime error that typically causes the application
to exit with exit status of 2, an error message, and a stack trace.
Before exiting, the panic proceeds up the call stack
and any deferred functions that have been queued
by functions in the call stack are executed.

The built-in `panic` function can be called
to manually trigger a panic.
Typically this should only be used when an error
occurs that callers are not expected to handle.
For expected errors, functions should return an
extra error return value, that callers can check.

The `panic` function can be passed any value,
but typically it is an error message.
For example, `panic("not happy")`.

Functions that call `panic` for some code paths
often have names that start with `Must`
to indicate this possibility.

Another way to output a stack trace is to
import the `runtime/debug` package
and call `debug.PrintStack()`.

In some circumstances when a panic occurs it is useful to
perform some cleanup before the application exits
or even prevent the application from exiting.
For example, a web server could choose to never exit
regardless of the errors that may occur.

The built-in `recover` function can be called
within a deferred function for either of these reasons.
It returns the value passed to the `panic` function.

If recovery is not possible, the deferred function can
call the `panic` function, passing it the same value.
This allows other deferred functions
higher in the call stack to recover from the error.

If recovery is possible, check the value returned
by the `recover` function. If it is not nil,
return the values to be used as the
return values of the function that panicked.
After this deferred function completes,
the function that panicked does not continue
at the statement after the panic.
Instead it returns to its caller
using these return values.

Recovering from a panic originating in another package
is not recommended.

It is only possible to recover from panics
that were initiated in the same goroutine.

The following simple example demonstrate
using `panic` and `recover`.
However, expected errors such as dividing by zero
should not be handled using `panic` and `recover`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func mustDivide(m, n float64) float64 {
    if n == 0 {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("cannot divide %f by zero", m))
    }
    return m / n
}

// It is important for this function have a named return type
// so its deferred function can set it.
// Alternatively, if this function had a named return type
// of type of error, the deferred function could set that.
func divideWithRecover(m, n float64) (result float64) {
    defer func() {
        message := recover() // nil when there was no panic
        if message != nil {
            fmt.Printf("%s; recovering\n", message)
            result = 0 // result for all divide by zero calls
        }
    }()
    return mustDivide(m, n)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(divideWithRecover(7, 2)) // 3.5
    fmt.Println(divideWithRecover(7, 0)) // 0
}
```
