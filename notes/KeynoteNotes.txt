Keynote Notes

Bullet line breaks
- position cursor where a break is desired and press option-enter

File Details
- A Keynote file is really a folder.
- Right-click on the file in Finder and select "Show Package Contents".
- Images embedded in the presentation will be in that directory.
- .pict files can be opened in Preview and saved as .png files.

Themes
- To change the theme, select File...Choose Theme...

Format Painter
- Keynote doesn't have this feature like PowerPoint does,
  but formats can be copied and pasted
  * Format ... Copy Style (cmd-opt-c)
  * Format ... Paste Style (cmd-opt-v)

Playing Presentations
- Press "h" to hide the presentation temporarily in order to
  demonstrate things in the previous application that was running,
  such as an IDE where you'd like to demo some code.
  To resume the presentation, click the Keynote icon in the dock
  that will have a green play button on it.
- Press "w" to turn the screen white and any other key to restore it.
- Press "b" to turn the screen black and any other key to restore it.
- Press the "+" or "-" key to bring up the "heads up display"
  that shows three slide minatures (previous, current and next) and
  allows you to move to any slide by repeatedly pressing the "+" and "-" keys.
- Enter any number followed by the enter key to go to that slide number.
  This also displays the "heads up display".

Animation Effects
- "Build In" effects specify effects to be applied
   when an object is first displayed on a slide.
- "Build Out" effects specify effects to be applied
  when an object is removed from a slide.
- "Action" effects specify
  * Move - to move an object along a line or curve
  * Opacity - to make an object fade a given percentage
  * Scale - to make an object shrink or expand from 50% to 200$
  * Rotate - to make an object spin through any number of degrees
   in either directory
- To specify a "Build In", "Build Out" or "Action" effect,
  select an object and click the third toolbar button in the Build Inspector.
- Use the "Order" drop down to specify
  the order in which the effects take place.
- To apply the same effect to multiple objects at the same time,
  group the objects before specifying the effect.
  If multiple objects are selected, the effect will be applied to each
  in the order they were selected instead of at the same time.
- Grouping or ungrouping objects removes the effect that was assigned.
- To specify when an effect should begin, click "More Options" and
  set "Start Build" to "On Click" or "Automatically after transition".

Aligning objects
- right-click the toolbar and select "Customize Toolbar..."
- add "Guides" and "Edges"
- click the "Edges" icon so it says "Edges On"
- click the "Guides" icon and select both
  "Show Guides at Object Center" and "Show Guides at Object Edges"
- this enables OmniGraffle-like alignment

Deleting slides
- right-click the toolbar and select "Customize Toolbar..."
- add "Delete" which makes it easier to delete a slide
- otherwise you have to right-click it in the Navigator list on the left
  and select "Delete"

Printing handouts
- if white image bullets were used
  * open the "Title & Bullets" master slide
  * select all the lines that start will bullets
  * open the Inspector
  * select the "Text" toolbar button and the "Bullets" tab
  * select "Text Bullets"
  * select any bullet shape from the drop-down list
- select File...Page Setup...
- select the Orientation button for portrait mode
- select File...Print
- select the "Handout" radio button
- select the desired number of slides per page
- deselect "Draft-quality printout
- select "Don't print slide backgrounds or object fills"
- select "Add borders around slides"
- select PDF...Save as PDF...

Slide Numbers
- To add slide numbers,
  * select the master slide
  * open the inspector
  * select the second toolbar button
  * select the "Appearance" tab
  * select the "Slide Number" checkbox
  * a text field for the slide number
    will be added to the lower-right corner
  * it can be moved to another location

Transitions
- To add the same transition to every slide
  * click the first slide in the list on the left
  * shift-click the last slide in the list on the left
  * if the Inspector isn't visible, select Show...Inspector
  * click the second toolbar button in the Inspector ("Slide")
  * select something from the "Effects" drop-down

Missing Features
- Shapes can't auto-size themselves based on the text inside them.
- There is no "curly brace" shape like in PowerPoint.
  Perhaps one could be drawn using the polygon tool and bezier curves.
- A shape can't be changed to a different shape.  For example, you can't
  change a rectangle with rounded corners to one with square corners.
  Well, you can by selecting the rounded rectangle and dragging a special
  handle that controls the corner radii to the left.
- Lines can't be connected to points on shapes.  This is an issue
  when shapes need to be dragged to new locations and you want
  the lines to remain connected.
- When zooming in, the display isn't centered on the selected item.
- You can only mask images with shapes, not shapes with shapes.
  More OmniGraffle-like shape operations would be nice.

Questions
- Is there a way to move to the next or previous slide when
  focus is in a text box?

Issues
- When text spills off the bottom side of a text box, it is invisible.
  However, a small + in a box at the bottom of the text box indicates
  that this has happened.
- The first line of text in rounded rectangles is indented slightly.
- It is inconvenient to store KeyNote presentations in Subversion
  because of the .svn directory problem.  See
  http://tapestryjava.blogspot.com/2007/09/mac-os-x-bundles-vs-subversion.html
  for a script that helps me with this by bundling presentations in
  an archive before committing.
  SVK, a decentralized version control system built on top of
  Subversion works better since it doesn't store the meta information
  in the project tree like Subversion does.  A nice aspect of this is
  when you commit, only the pieces of your presentation that have
  changed get committed.
- Group and Ungroup options aren't on context menu.  They must be selected
  from the Arrange menu or keyboard shortcut can be used.
  * cmd-option-g to group
  * cmd-option-shift-g to ungroup
- The colors of image bullets aren't adjusted when printing black & white
  handouts.  If they are white on a dark background then they don't
  appear at all. This happens when using the "Blackboard" theme.
- When "Bullets & Numbering" for a text box is set to "No Bullets",
  "Text Indent" should be set to "0 px".
