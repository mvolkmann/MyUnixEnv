Vim Notes
- in HTML, can use after an element name to see possible attribute

Installing Plugins
- see instructions under "Ruby Support" that describe using Pathogen
  * definitely the way to manage plugins!
- to see list of plugins that were successfully installed,
  :scriptnames
- see "Submodules" section in GitNotes.txt
  * describes how you want to add Vim plugin Git repos
  * example
    - cd ~/MyUnixEnv
    - git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git .vim/bundle/command-t

Starting
  vim [filename]          - to start in a specified file
  vim +E                  - to start in file explorer
  vim .                   - same as vim +E
  vim --remote {filename} - to edit file in existing vim session

Help
- for help on any topic, :help {topic} or :h {topic}
- for general help, :help user-manual
- for help on version 7 features, :help version7
- to navigate a link in the help, position the cursor over the link
  and press ctrl-]
- to return to the previous page, press ctrl-t

Configuration is specified in
  _vimrc under Windows (in your C:\VIM directory)
  .vimrc under Unix (in ~)

Installing Vim from source
- download and unzip source
- ./configure --enable-rubyinterp
  * Ruby is needed by some plugins such as Command-T
- make install

Installing Vim 7 under Windows
- download gvim70d.exe from ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unstable/pc
- double-click the .exe file
- for better Ruby support,
  * add the following to C:\Vim\_vimrc
    autocmd FileType ruby,eruby
    set omnifunc=rubycomplete#Complete
  * from a command prompt, run "gem install vim-ruby
  * download rubycomplete.vim from
    http://blog.hasno.info/blog/segfault/dev/2006/04/10/
    vim-7-ruby-omni-completion.html
    into C:\Vim\vim70d\autoload

---

Bash
- To use vi keystrokes for bash command-line editing,
  set -o vi

Build under Linux
- download source from http://www.vim.org
- bunzip2 vim-6.3.tar.bz2
- ./configure
- make GUI=yes
- make install (as root)
- to run GUI version, enter "gvim"

Buffers
  ctrl-^               - switch to previous buffer
  :bn[ext]             - switch to next buffer
  :bp[rev]             - switch to previous buffer
  :ls                  - list buffers (same as :buffers)
		buffer characteristic indicators include: 
    % - buffer in current window
    # - alternate buffer for ":e #" and CTRL-^
    a - active buffer: it is loaded and visible
    h - hidden buffer: loaded, but not displayed in a window
    = - readonly buffer
    + - modified buffer
    x - buffer with read errors
  :b{buffer-number} - to switch to the indicated buffer
  :b {name-fragment} - to switch to the indicated buffer
    Tab completion can be used to cycle through all the buffers
    whose file path contains the text.
    Very cool!
  :bd[{buffer-number}] - to delete the indicated buffer
    If buffer-number is omitted, currently displyed buffer is deleted.
    Multiple buffer numbers can be specified, separated by spaces.
    This really just marks the buffer as unlisted.
    To see it, use :ls!.
  :bw[{buffer-number}] - to wipeout the indicated buffer
    Unlike :bd, this completely deletes the buffer.
 
Change (delete and enter insert mode)
  c  - change selection (deletes selected text)
  cc - change line (deletes current line)
  cw - change word (deletes word under cursor)
  c$ - change from cursor to end of line
  C  - same as c$
  s  - substitute characters (can precede with # of characters)
       and enter insert mode
  c/{text}Enter - change all characters from cursor to given text

Code Indenting
  Put "filetype indent plugin on" in .vimrc to use filetype-dependent
  settings specified in files in the .vim/ftplugin directory.
  The settings in these files will override settings in your .vimrc.
  For example, create .vim/ftplugin/java.vim containing
    set shiftwidth=4
    set tabstop=4
  :set cindent        - for indenting source code
                        (requires "filetype indent on" in .vimrc)
  :set shiftwidth={#} - sets number of spaces used for indentation
  :set sw={#}         - same as above
  :set cinoptions=(1s - to indent continuation lines with an open paren
                        by one shiftwidth
                        (see :help cinoptions-values for more options
                         and a list of the defaults)
  ==                  - fixes indentation of current line or selected lines
  =                   - fixes indentation of selected lines
  >                   - indents selected lines
  >>                  - indents current line
  <                   - outdents selected lines
  <<                  - outdents current line
  gg=G                - goes to first line then reindents entire file

Color Schemes
- Now using Solarized color theme
- See Syntax...Highlight Test in GVim
- Put "syntax enable" in .vimrc to enable colors.
- :hi - to see all the current syntax colors
- color numbers (Are these standard?)
  0 = gray
  1 = red
  2 = green
  3 = yellow
  4 = blue
  5 = magenta
  6 = cyan
  7 = white
- Standard color names (case insensitive)
    white, lightgray, gray, darkgray, black,
    red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan
    above preceded by "light" or "dark"
    lightpink, pink, orange, darkorange, purple
- Save color scheme .vim files in
    ~/.vim/colors for Unix
    $VIM_HOME/vimfiles/colors for Windows
    Also look in /usr/share/vim/vim72/colors.
- Find valid color names in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt.
- To change to a named color scheme defined in a .vim file
  stored in the appropriate colors directory ...
  :colo[rscheme] {name} - use color scheme from file {name}.vim
  For example, :colo evening
  To cycle through all the installed color schemes,
  enter ":colorscheme " and then continually press Tab.
  To see all the installed color schemes,
  enter ":colo " and press ctrl-d.
- Font styles
    bold, italic, underline, reverse, standout, NONE (to reset)
- Font names
    default is FixedSys
    set with font attribute
    ex. hi Comment font=Courier
- To change an individual color, here are some exxamples.
  :hi Normal guifg=black guibg=white
  :hi comment ctermfg=blue - when using a terminal window
  :hi comment guifg=blue - when using a GUI
  :hi Search ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
  :hi LineNr ctermfg=0 - to display line numbers in gray
- Can also set ctermbg and guibg
- Recommendations
  hi Normal font=Fixedsys ctermfg=black ctermbg=white guifg=black guibg=white
  hi Comment ctermfg=darkgray guifg=darkgray
  hi Constant ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
  hi Define ctermfg=magenta guifg=magenta
  hi Fold ctermfg=0 ctermbg=1 " gray on red
  hi Identifier ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
  hi IncSearch ctermfg=white ctermbg=gray
  hi LineNr ctermfg=gray guifg=gray
  hi Search cterm=reverse ctermfg=3 ctermbg=1 \
            gui=reverse guifg=yellow guibg=red
  hi Special ctermfg=5 guifg=orange
  hi Statement ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
  hi Todo ctermfg=3 - to display TODO in comments in yellow
  hi Type ctermfg=red guifg=red

Comments in .vimrc file
- precede with " character

Compiling code
- See :help quickfix.txt

Completion after :
  tab - to complete a command name, file path, ...
    - To cycle through possible matches, keep pressing tab.
  ctrl-d - display list of all possible matches

Completion in insert mode
  ctrl-n - cycle to next matching word and substitute it
  ctrl-p - cycle to previous matching word and substitute it
  These consider all words in all open buffers.

  To select word under cursor in list,
  just continue typing (ex. space).

  Can also use up and down arrow keys to navigate list,
  but must press return key to substitute a word.

  Can enable this with tab key using the following line,
  but this conflicts with the snipmate plugin, so don't do it!
  imap <TAB> <C-n>

  To allow filtering of word list while typing,
  begin a particular form of completion (ex. ctrl-x ctrl-k),
  immediately press ctrl-p, then type.

  To cancel completion without selecting a word, ctrl-e.

  To only consider words in the current buffer, ctrl-x ctrl-n.

  For dictionary lookup, ctrl-x ctrl-k.
  Configure location of dictionary file in .vimrc
  with set dictionary={file-path}.

  For thesaurus lookup, ctrl-x ctrl-t.
  Configure location of thesaurus file in .vimrc
  with set thesaurus={file-path}.

  For filename completion of files in current working directory,
  ctrl-x ctrl-f.
  It's not necessary to type anything before invoking this.
  See "Working Directory" section to commands to see and change it.
  Use ctrl-n and ctrl-p to navigate the list.
  If on a directory, press ctrl-x ctrl-f again to navigate into it.

  Also see section on Omni-completion.

Copy (yank)
  y  - yank (copy) selection
  yw - yank (copy) word (cursor position to end of work)
  yiw - yank (copy) word (under cursor)
  yy - yank (copy) current line
  Y  - same as yy

Counts
  Most commands can be preceded by a number that indicates
  how many times the command should be executed.

Delete
  d  - delete selection
  dd - delete current line
  dw - delete word under cursor or
       whitespace from cursor to next non-whitespace
  d$ - delete from cursor to end of line
  D  - same as d$
  x  - delete character under cursor or visual selection
  d/{text}Enter - delete all characters from cursor to given text
  To delete without affecting the clipboard, preceded command with "_
  which sends the deleted content to the "blackhole" register.
  For example, "_dd.

Diffs
  There are many ways to use this.  One way is as follows.
  - open first file
  - ":sp" to split the window
  - open second file in second window
  - ":diffthis" in both buffers
  - "]c" to move to next difference
  - "[c" to move to previous difference
  - ":set nodiff" to turn off diff in the current buffer
  - ":set noscrollbind" to turn off coordinated scrolling
    in the current buffer
  There must be an easier way to turn this off!
  Supposedly it's much better in Vim 7 which isn't stable yet.
  
Exploring
  :E[xplore] [start-path]  - open explorer in current window
  :S[explore] [start-path] - open explorer in split window
  Once in explorer window,
  ?         - toggles display of help on keys to use in explorer
  Enter key - opens file/directory under cursor in explorer 
  o         - opens file/directory in new window, leaving explorer displayed
  -         - goes up to parent directory
  i         - toggles display of file sizes and modification dates
  D         - delete file
  R         - rename file

Filtering Lines
- To pass a range of lines to a shell command,
  select the lines using V, type ! and then a shell command.
- The selected lines will be replaced by the command output.
- For example, to sort imports at the top of a Java source file,
  elect them and enter "!sort".

Folding
- To configure folding of javadoc comments, add this to .vimrc.
  autocmd FileType java :set fmr=/**,*/ fdm=marker fdc=1
- Commands to control folding include
  zfap - create a new fold
  zr - reduce/open all folds one level deep
  zR - recursive version of zr (all levels)
  zm - fold more; close all folds
  zM - recursive version of zm (all levels)
  zo - open fold under cursor
  zc - close fold under cursor
  zf - fold selected lines
  zj - move to next fold
  zk - move to previous fold
  zd - delete fold, not content of it
  zE - delete all folds, not their content

Fonts

  * :Git diff to see differences in current file
    can be performed with :Gdiff
    - committed version is on left and uncommitted version is on right
    - added lines are green
    - removed lines are red
    - when run on a file containing merge conflict markers,
      a three-way merge with three vertical splits is presented
    - the target file (2) is on the left
    - the merge file (3) is on the right
    - the file with conflict markers (1) is in the center
    - position cursone on a conflict in center split
    - to keep changes from target (left) enter :diffget //2 | diffup
    - to keep changes from merge (right) enter :diffget //3 | diffup
    - the diffup command in the previous two lines
      updates diff highlighting of the buffers
      and can be run separately with :diffupdate
    - to jump to next changeset, press ]c
    - to jump to previous changeset, press [c
    - when finished resolving conflicts
      * make sure cursor is in center window
      * enter ":only" to close the target and merge windows
      * :Gcommit -av
- relative paths passed to commands
  * paths that start with / are relative to the repository root directory

- in HTML, can use after an element name to see possible attribute
- in CSS, can use after a property name to see possible values

Opening, Saving and Quiting
  :e {name} - edit file {name}; file is created if it doesn't exist
              Can use FTP to edit remote files.  For example,
              :e ftp://www.ociweb.com/index.html
              Can use scp to edit remote files.  For example,
              :e scp://volkmanm@xi/BAE/JSFTacan/
                 branches/dev-branch/test/vector/baevector.h
              (will prompt for username/password;
               didn't seem to write changes back!)

    This is a problem under Unix because it pauses execution!
    Press ctrl-Q to resume.

Options
  One way to view and set options is to enter ":options:".
  This opens a window that displays all the options,
  provides a description of each, and shows the current value.

Paste
  p  - paste after cursor
  P  - paste before cursor
  ]p - paste with indentation adjustment (for source code)
  * To paste text from another application
    that may contain comment delimiters
    - :set paste!

    - :set paste!

Reflow text in a paragraph
- position cursor anywhere in a paragraph and enter gqap

Registers
  A register is like a named clipboard.
  It holds deleted text that can be pasted.
  To place deleted text in a register,
  precede delete or change command with "{register-name} (a-z).
  To paste text from a register,
  precede paste command with "{register-name} (a-z).

Reverse order of all lines
  :g/.*/m0 - for all lines, move it to line zero

Ruby Support
- install Pathogen
  * see https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
- cd ~/.vim/bundle
- git clone https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby.git
- add the following to .vimrc
  set nocompatible      " We're running Vim, not Vi! (default setting)

  :set incsearch - move to search matches while typing
  :set hlsearch - highlight all matches after pressing Enter
  :set ic - case-insensitive searches
  :set noic - case-sensitive searches
  /{pattern} - search forward for next occurrence, cursor placed at match start
  /{pattern}/e - same as previous, but cursor placed at match end
  ?{pattern} - search backward for previous occurence
  * - search forward for next occurence of word under cursor
  # - search backward for previous occurence of word under cursor
  :noh[lsearch] - turn off highlighting of matches from last search

  :%s/{pattern}/{string}/g  - all occurrences 
  :%s/{pattern}/{string}/gc - all occurences with confirmation prompts
  :%s/\t/  /g - replace all tabs with two spaces
  :set ff=unix - removes Windows carriage returns from all lines
  :%s/ctrl-vctrl-m$//g - also removes Windows carriage returns from all lines
                         and is sometimes needed instead of the previous
  :%s/ctrl-vctrl-m/ctrl-vctrl-m/g - replaces Windows carriage with Unix ones
  :.,$s/{pattern}/{string}/g - all occurrences from the cursor to end of file

Select
  v - begin visual selection in char mode;
      now move cursor to end of selection;
      includes char under cursor;
      Under Windows, hold down shift key while moving cursor.
      To avoid this, change "behave mswin" to "behave xterm" in _vimrc.
  V - begin visual selection in line mode
  ctrl-V - begin visual selection in block mode
  o - changes end of selection being moved

Spell check
- to start, enter
  :setlocal spell spelllang=en_us
  * you have <leader>s mapped to toggle this in normal and insert modes
- to jump to the next error, ]s
- to get a list of suggested replacements, z=
  * enter number of replacement and press <cr>
    or just press <cr> to make no change
- to repeat the replacement made by z= throughout the document, :spellr
- to add word under cursor to list of good works, zg
- for more see http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html

Tab Pages
- to open a new, empty tab, :tabe
- to close the current tab, :tabc
- to close all other tabs, :tabo
- to open a file in a new tab, 
  ???
- to navigate to a different tab,
  click the tab with the mouse
  or type "gt" for goto tab
  or press ctrl-PgDn or ctrl-PgUp
- to have tabs always show even when there is only one window,
  add the following to _vimrc
  set showtabline=2
- to use a tab to edit a file opened using "Edit with Vim"
  from the Windows Explorer context-sensitive menu,
  add " -p" to the Windows registry under
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Vim\Gvim\path using regedit

Tags
- For better tagging, brew install ctags-exuberant
- To generate a "tags" file for the current directory and all subdirectories,
  enter "ctags -R".
  This works for 41 languages!
- To visit a tag in Vim, do one of the following:
  1) :ta[g] {tag}
  2) position cursor over tag-string and press ctrl-]
     This is the default telnet escape character.
     To avoid escaping to a telnet prompt,
     include the -E option when starting telnet to disable escaping.
- To return to the previous location, press ctrl-t.
- To start vi and immediately visit a given tag,
  vi -t {tag}
- When there is more than one match,
  vi displays all matches and allows one to be selected by number.
- For more info, enter ":help tags" in vi

Shell commands
- see Conque at http://code.google.com/p/conque/
- may need to install newer version of python (works with 3.2.1)
- download and unzip into .vim/bundle directory
- to run a bash shell in the current Vim buffer, :ConqueTerm bash
- other examples
  :ConqueTermSplit mysql -h localhost -u joe -p sock_collection
  :ConqueTermTab bash
  :ConqueTermVSplit bash
- when running Vim from a terminal window,
  can press ctrl-z to put Vim in the background
  and enter fg to return to Vim in the foreground

Slime and Screen
- to install vim-slime
  * install Pathogen if not already done
  * cd ~/.vim/bundle
  * git clone git://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime.git
  * restart Vim?
- on a Mac, screen is already installed
- to use
  * open a Terminal window
  * enter "screen -S {session-name}" to start a screen session (ex. name is node)
  * start Vim
  * open a file
  * position the cursor in a block of lines (forward and backward to a blank line)
    or select the lines to be copied
  * press ctrl-c ctrl-c to copy it to a screen session
  * the first time this is done, slime will prompt for a screen session name
    - enter a name (like "node")
    - press return a second time to accept the screen window name of "0"
  * the code will be copied to the screen session
- common use case
  * start a REPL in the screen session (such as node)

Notes from Bill Odom's talk on 2/16/12

NERD_Tree plugin
Google "recommended vim plugins for javascript coding"
#1 JavaScript indenter - by Preston Koprivica
#2 Vastly improved javascript indentation - by Darrick Wiebe
default syntax highlighting for JavaScript just uses highlighting for C?
Pathogen
JSLint - see link from crypticswarm blog to Jonathan Palardy page
JSHint - manalang jshint.vim - is this what you are using?
Conque - a shell that runs in Vim
see "Resources" slides in his deck
Bufexplorer
Taglist - works with exuberant-ctags; runs it for you
DoctorJS - from Mozilla; tags JavaScript source files
Yehuda Katz article "Everyone Who Tried to Convice Me to use Vim was Wrong"
- Bill doesn't like his recommended list of plugins for newbies
