Vim Notes

Installing Plugins
- see instructions under "Ruby Support" that describe using Pathogen
  * definitely the way to manage plugins!
- see "Submodules" section in GitNotes.txt
  * describes how you want to add Vim plugin Git repos
  * example
    - cd ~/MyUnixEnv
    - git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git .vim/bundle/command-t

Starting
  vim [filename]          - to start in a specified file
  vim +E                  - to start in file explorer
  vim .                   - same as vim +E
  vim --remote {filename} - to edit file in existing vim session

Help
- for general help, :help user-manual
- for help on version 7 features, :help version7
- to navigate a link in the help, position the cursor over the link
  and press ctrl-]
- to return to the previous page, press ctrl-t

Configuration is specified in
  _vimrc under Windows (in your C:\VIM directory)
  .vimrc under Unix (in ~)

---

Installing Vim 7 under Windows
- download gvim70d.exe from ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unstable/pc
- double-click the .exe file
- for better Ruby support,
  * add the following to C:\Vim\_vimrc
    autocmd FileType ruby,eruby
    set omnifunc=rubycomplete#Complete
  * from a command prompt, run "gem install vim-ruby
  * download rubycomplete.vim from
    http://blog.hasno.info/blog/segfault/dev/2006/04/10/
    vim-7-ruby-omni-completion.html
    into C:\Vim\vim70d\autoload

---

Bash
- To use vi keystrokes for bash command-line editing,
  set -o vi

Build under Linux
- download source from http://www.vim.org
- bunzip2 vim-6.3.tar.bz2
- ./configure
- make GUI=yes
- make install (as root)
- to run GUI version, enter "gvim"

Buffers
  ctrl-^               - switch to previous buffer
  :bn[ext]             - switch to next buffer
  :bp[rev]             - switch to previous buffer
  :ls                  - list buffers (same as :buffers)
		buffer characteristic indicators include: 
    % - buffer in current window
    # - alternate buffer for ":e #" and CTRL-^
    a - active buffer: it is loaded and visible
    h - hidden buffer: loaded, but not displayed in a window
    = - readonly buffer
    + - modified buffer
    x - buffer with read errors
  :b{buffer-number} - to switch to the indicated buffer
  :b {name-fragment} - to switch to the indicated buffer
    Tab completion can be used to cycle through all the buffers
    whose file path contains the text.
    Very cool!
  :bd[{buffer-number}] - to delete the indicated buffer
    If buffer-number is omitted, currently displyed buffer is deleted.
    Multiple buffer numbers can be specified, separated by spaces.
    This really just marks the buffer as unlisted.
    To see it, use :ls!.
  :bw[{buffer-number}] - to wipeout the indicated buffer
    Unlike :bd, this completely deletes the buffer.
 
Change (delete and enter insert mode)
  c  - change selection (deletes selected text)
  cc - change line (deletes current line)
  cw - change word (deletes word under cursor)
  c$ - change from cursor to end of line
  C  - same as c$
  s  - substitute characters (can precede with # of characters)
       and enter insert mode
  c/{text}Enter - change all characters from cursor to given text

Code Indenting
  Put "filetype indent plugin on" in .vimrc to use filetype-dependent
  settings specified in files in the .vim/ftplugin directory.
  The settings in these files will override settings in your .vimrc.
  For example, create .vim/ftplugin/java.vim containing
    set shiftwidth=4
    set tabstop=4
  :set cindent        - for indenting source code
                        (requires "filetype indent on" in .vimrc)
  :set shiftwidth={#} - sets number of spaces used for indentation
  :set sw={#}         - same as above
  :set cinoptions=(1s - to indent continuation lines with an open paren
                        by one shiftwidth
                        (see :help cinoptions-values for more options
                         and a list of the defaults)
  ==                  - fixes indentation of current line or selected lines
  =                   - fixes indentation of selected lines
  >                   - indents selected lines
  >>                  - indents current line
  <                   - outdents selected lines
  <<                  - outdents current line
  gg=G                - goes to first line then reindents entire file

Color Schemes
- Now using Solarized color theme
- See Syntax...Highlight Test in GVim
- Put "syntax enable" in .vimrc to enable colors.
- :hi - to see all the current syntax colors
- color numbers (Are these standard?)
  0 = gray
  1 = red
  2 = green
  3 = yellow
  4 = blue
  5 = magenta
  6 = cyan
  7 = white
- Standard color names (case insensitive)
    white, lightgray, gray, darkgray, black,
    red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan
    above preceded by "light" or "dark"
    lightpink, pink, orange, darkorange, purple
- Save color scheme .vim files in
    ~/.vim/colors for Unix
    $VIM_HOME/vimfiles/colors for Windows
    Also look in /usr/share/vim/vim72/colors.
- Find valid color names in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt.
- To change to a named color scheme defined in a .vim file
  stored in the appropriate colors directory ...
  :colo[rscheme] {name} - use color scheme from file {name}.vim
  For example, :colo evening
  To cycle through all the installed color schemes,
  enter ":colorscheme " and then continually press Tab.
  To see all the installed color schemes,
  enter ":colo " and press ctrl-d.
- Font styles
    bold, italic, underline, reverse, standout, NONE (to reset)
- Font names
    default is FixedSys
    set with font attribute
    ex. hi Comment font=Courier
- To change an individual color, here are some exxamples.
  :hi Normal guifg=black guibg=white
  :hi comment ctermfg=blue - when using a terminal window
  :hi comment guifg=blue - when using a GUI
  :hi Search ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
  :hi LineNr ctermfg=0 - to display line numbers in gray
- Can also set ctermbg and guibg
- Recommendations
  hi Normal font=Fixedsys ctermfg=black ctermbg=white guifg=black guibg=white
  hi Comment ctermfg=darkgray guifg=darkgray
  hi Constant ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
  hi Define ctermfg=magenta guifg=magenta
  hi Fold ctermfg=0 ctermbg=1 " gray on red
  hi Identifier ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
  hi IncSearch ctermfg=white ctermbg=gray
  hi LineNr ctermfg=gray guifg=gray
  hi Search cterm=reverse ctermfg=3 ctermbg=1 \
            gui=reverse guifg=yellow guibg=red
  hi Special ctermfg=5 guifg=orange
  hi Statement ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
  hi Todo ctermfg=3 - to display TODO in comments in yellow
  hi Type ctermfg=red guifg=red

Comments in .vimrc file
- precede with " character

Compiling code
- See :help quickfix.txt

Completion after :
  tab - to complete a command name, file path, ...
    - To cycle through possible matches, keep pressing tab.
  ctrl-d - display list of all possible matches

Completion in insert mode
  ctrl-n - cycle to next matching word
  ctrl-p - cycle to previous matching word
  To enable this with tab key,
  imap <TAB> <C-n>

Copy (yank)
  y  - yank (copy) selection
  yw - yank (copy) word (cursor position to end of work)
  yiw - yank (copy) word (under cursor)
  yy - yank (copy) current line
  Y  - same as yy

Counts
  Most commands can be preceded by a number that indicates
  how many times the command should be executed.

Delete
  d  - delete selection
  dd - delete current line
  dw - delete word under cursor or
       whitespace from cursor to next non-whitespace
  d$ - delete from cursor to end of line
  D  - same as d$
  x  - delete character under cursor or visual selection
  d/{text}Enter - delete all characters from cursor to given text
  To delete without affecting the clipboard, preceded command with "_
  which sends the deleted content to the "blackhole" register.
  For example, "_dd.

Diffs
  There are many ways to use this.  One way is as follows.
  - open first file
  - ":sp" to split the window
  - open second file in second window
  - ":diffthis" in both buffers
  - "]c" to move to next difference
  - "[c" to move to previous difference
  - ":set nodiff" to turn off diff in the current buffer
  - ":set noscrollbind" to turn off coordinated scrolling
    in the current buffer
  There must be an easier way to turn this off!
  Supposedly it's much better in Vim 7 which isn't stable yet.
  
Exploring
  :E[xplore] [start-path]  - open explorer in current window
  :S[explore] [start-path] - open explorer in split window
  Once in explorer window,
  ?         - toggles display of help on keys to use in explorer
  Enter key - opens file/directory under cursor in explorer 
  o         - opens file/directory in new window, leaving explorer displayed
  -         - goes up to parent directory
  i         - toggles display of file sizes and modification dates
  D         - delete file
  R         - rename file
  :pwd to see directory of current file

Filtering Lines
- To pass a range of lines to a shell command,
  select the lines using V, type ! and then a shell command.
- The selected lines will be replaced by the command output.
- For example, to sort imports at the top of a Java source file,
  elect them and enter "!sort".

Folding
- To configure folding of javadoc comments, add this to .vimrc.
  autocmd FileType java :set fmr=/**,*/ fdm=marker fdc=1
- Commands to control folding include
  zfap - create a new fold
  zr - open all folds
  zm - close all folds
  zo - open fold under cursor

Opening, Saving and Quiting
  :e {name} - edit file {name}; file is created if it doesn't exist
              Can use FTP to edit remote files.  For example,
              :e ftp://www.ociweb.com/index.html
              Can use scp to edit remote files.  For example,
              :e scp://volkmanm@xi/BAE/JSFTacan/
                 branches/dev-branch/test/vector/baevector.h
              (will prompt for username/password;
               didn't seem to write changes back!)
  :e        - reload the current file (useful if modified outside vim)
  :r {name} - insert content of file {name} after cursor
  :w        - write (save)
  :q        - quit unless changed
  :q!       - quit and discard changes

  ctrl-s    - saves changes regardless of mode (same as :update)
    This is a problem under Unix because it pauses execution!
    Press ctrl-Q to resume.

Options
  One way to view and set options is to enter ":options:".
  This opens a window that displays all the options,
  provides a description of each, and shows the current value.

Paste
  p  - paste after cursor
  P  - paste before cursor
  ]p - paste with indentation adjustment (for source code)
  * To paste text from another application
    that may contain comment delimiters
    - :set paste!
    - cmd-v (without being in insert mode)
    - :set paste!

Registers
  A register is like a named clipboard.
  It holds deleted text that can be pasted.
  To place deleted text in a register,
  precede delete or change command with "{register-name} (a-z).
  To paste text from a register,
  precede paste command with "{register-name} (a-z).

Reverse order of all lines
  :g/.*/m0 - for all lines, move it to line zero

Ruby Support
- install Pathogen
  * see https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
- cd ~/.vim/bundle
- git clone https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby.git
- add the following to .vimrc
  set nocompatible      " We're running Vim, not Vi! (default setting)
  syntax on             " Enable syntax highlighting
  filetype on           " Enable filetype detection
  filetype indent on    " Enable filetype-specific indenting
  filetype plugin on    " Enable filetype-specific plugins
- the previous three lines can be written as
  filetype indent plugin on

  :%s/ctrl-vctrl-m/ctrl-vctrl-m/g - replaces Windows carriage with Unix ones
  :.,$s/{pattern}/{string}/g - all occurrences from the cursor to end of file

Select
  v - begin visual selection in char mode;
      now move cursor to end of selection;
      includes char under cursor;
      Under Windows, hold down shift key while moving cursor.
      To avoid this, change "behave mswin" to "behave xterm" in _vimrc.
  V - begin visual selection in line mode
  ctrl-V - begin visual selection in block mode

Tab Pages
- to open a new, empty tab, :tabe
- to close the current tab, :tabc
- to close all other tabs, :tabo

  ???
- to navigate to a different tab,
  click the tab with the mouse
  or type "gt" for goto tab
  or press ctrl-PgDn or ctrl-PgUp
- to have tabs always show even when there is only one window,
  add the following to _vimrc
  set showtabline=2
- to use a tab to edit a file opened using "Edit with Vim"
  from the Windows Explorer context-sensitive menu,
  add " -p" to the Windows registry under
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Vim\Gvim\path using regedit

Tags
- To generate a "tags" file for the current directory and all subdirectories,
  enter "ctags -R".
  This works for 41 languages!
- To visit a tag in Vim, do one of the following:
  1) :ta[g] {tag}
  2) position cursor over tag-string and press ctrl-]
     This is the default telnet escape character.
     To avoid escaping to a telnet prompt,
     include the -E option when starting telnet to disable escaping.
- To return to the previous location, press ctrl-t.
- To start vi and immediately visit a given tag,
  vi -t {tag}
- When there is more than one match,
  vi displays all matches and allows one to be selected by number.
- For more info, enter ":help tags" in vi

Shell commands
- see Conque at http://code.google.com/p/conque/
- may need to install newer version of python (works with 3.2.1)
- download and unzip into .vim/bundle directory
- to run a bash shell in the current Vim buffer, :ConqueTerm bash
- other examples
  :ConqueTermSplit mysql -h localhost -u joe -p sock_collection

  * press ctrl-c ctrl-c to copy it to a screen session
  * the first time this is done, slime will prompt for a screen session name
    - enter a name (like "node")
    - press return a second time to accept the screen window name of "0"
  * the code will be copied to the screen session
- common use case
  * start a REPL in the screen session (such as node)
