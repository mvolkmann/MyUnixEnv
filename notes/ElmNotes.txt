Elm notes

Overview
- a functional language for building web applications
  that compiles to HTML and JavaScript
- implemented in Haskell
- focuses on reusable functions, not reusable components
  * React components can also be defined using functions
- input event handling attributes like "onClick" take a message
  that is sent to the update function when the event occurs
  * this is like dispatching actions in Redux

Tools to install
- Installer installs several tools.
- elm-repl
  * to start the repl, enter "elm repl"
  * requires a network connection in order to get the core modules
  * enter Elm expressions to evaluate them
    - in the repl, multiline expressions require a
      backslash at the end of each line except the last
  * can import modules into repl
    - see example module FnAppl.elm in ~/Documents/programming/languages/Elm/playground
    - start repl
    - enter "import FnAppl"
    - enter FnAppl.total1 and FnAppl.total2 (should get 46.2: for both)

  * to exit, enter ":exit"
- elm-reactor
  * provides an HTTP server, watches files, automatically compiles, and reloads
  * to use, cd to a project directory and enter "elm reactor"
  * supports time-travel debugging (How is it used?)
- elm-make
  * compiles Elm code to HTML and JavaScript
  * enter "elm make {name}.elm"
- elm-package
  * like npm for Elm, see install, publish, bump, and diff commands
  * libraries are installed in elm-stuff/packages
  * to create a basic application with no optional libraries
    - create a new directory
    - cd to it
    - enter "elm package install"
      * installs elm-lang/html, elm-lang/virtual-dom, and elm-lang/core
      * creates elm-package.json
  * to install a library, enter "elm package {owner}/{name}"
- elm-format
  * formats code
- editor plugins
  * including Vim
    - see https://github.com/ElmCast/elm-vim
    - to run unit tests from within Vim,
      npm install -g elm-test
    - for code completion and doc lookups,
      npm install -g elm-oracle

Issues
- can only be used to develop web applications
- needs ability to read from stdin and write to stdout
- needs ability to read and write files
- needs ability to run as a script
- not very popular yet, so limited opportunities to use in consulting
- mainly supported by one company, NoRedInk, Evan and Richard
- elm-format causes many statements to use multiple lines unnecessarily
  * ex. variable and function Declarations, case expressions, ...
- elm-format inserts too many blank lines
  which results in less code being visible
- elm-format uses 4-space indentation which is ugly
- defining custom infix operators seems like a bad idea
  from a readability standpoint for readers of your code
  that are unaware of your custom infix operators
- "elm-stuff" is a silly directory name
  * What ends up here besides the "packages" directory?
- why is the ternary operator not supported?
- the official Elm documentation
  * pretends that ES6 either doesn't exist or isn't commonly available
  * ignores the availability of Flow and TypeScript
- using the repl requires a network connection

Core Library Default Imports
- the following are imported by default into every .elm file
  * Basics - everything
  * List - only List and (::)
  * Maybe - Maybe, Just, and Nothing
  * Result - Result, Ok, and Error
  * String - only the String module, not individual functions
  * Tuple - only the Tuple module, not individual functions
  * Debug - only the Debug module, not individual functions
  * Platform - only Program
  * Platform.Cmd - only Cmd and (!)
  * Platform.Sub - only Sub

Comments
- single-line: -- comment
- multi-line: {- comment -}
  * can nest

Bool type
- values are True and False

Char type
- represents a single character
- delimit with single quotes
- ex. 'a'

Number types
- Int, Float

Math
- use standard operators and parentheses
- ex. 5 / 2 -- 2.5 : Float
- ex. 5 // 2 -- 2 : Int -- integer division

Operators
- can use a functions by surrounding with parens
- ex. (+) 2 3 -- 5
- ex. ((+) 2) 3 -- 5

String type
- delimit with double quotes
- for multi-line, delimit with triple double quotes
  * ex. """ This can span many lines. """
- concatenate with ++
  * "foo" ++ "bar" is the same as (++) "foo" "bar"
    - parens around operator are required
- to use library functions, import String (really required?)
  * ex. String.length "abc"
- functions include contains, endsWith, isEmpty, join, length,
  pad, padLeft, padRight, repeat, reverse, slice, split,
  startsWith, toLower, toUpper, trim, trimLeft, and trimRight
- higher-order functions that operate on Chars in a String include
  any, all, filter, foldl, foldr, and map
- append is an alternative to ++ for concatenating two strings
- concat is an alternative to ++ for concatenating any number of strings
- cons adds a character to the beginning
- dropLeft takes an Int and a String and drops characters from the left
- dropRight takes an Int and a String and drops characters from the right
- fromChar takes a char and returns a string containing it
- fromList returns a String created from a List of Chars
- indexes returns a List of indexes of a given substring
- indices is an alias for indexes
- left takes an Int and a String and returns characters from the left
- lines returns a List of lines in a string, splitting on newlines
- right takes an Int and a String and returns characters from the right
- toList returns a List of Chars in a String
- uncons returns a tuple containing the first character
  and a string of the remaining characters
- words returns a List of words in a string, splitting on whitespace

Type Conversions
- no automatic type coercions
- must be done explicitly
- anything to String: toString
- String to Bool: ?
- String to Int: String.toInt
- String to Float: String.toFloat

List type
- comma-separated list of values surrounded by square brackets
  * ex. [1, 2, 3]
  * alternate syntax
    1 :: [2, 3]
    1 :: 2 :: [3]
    1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []
- all values must have the same type
- immutable so many functions create a new List
  that shares memory with previous versions
- List functions include all, any, append, concat, drop, filter,
  foldl, foldr, head, intersperse, isEmpty, length, map, maximum,
  member, minimum, partition, product, range, repeat, reverse, scanl,
  singleton, sort, sortBy, sortWith, sum, tail, take, unzip
- (::) adds an element to the front
- map2, map3, map4, and map5 map a number of lists instead of just one
- concatMap, filterMap, indexMap
- it's functions take a list and possibly other arguments
- functions include: isEmpty, length, reverse, sort, filter, and map
  * called with "List." prefix to qualify them
- can specify the type of the values
- ex. List String or List (User Int) - a List of tuples

Tuples
- comma-separated list of values surrounded by parentheses
- like a list, but has a fixed length and values can have different types
- functions include first, second, mapFirst, and mapSecond
- can use pattern matching in function parameters to extract field values
  * like JavaScript array destruturing
  * ex.
    distanceToOrigin (x, y) = sqrt (x^2 + y^2)
    point = (3, 4)
    d = distanceToOrigin point -- 5

Records
- set of key/value pairs similar to a JavaScript object
  * Elm calls these "fields"
- to create: { key1 = value1, key2 = value2, ... }
  * note the use of = instead of : as JavaScript uses
- to access a value:
  rec.key or
  .key rec (treats .key like a function that is passed rec)
- can use .key function with List.map
  * ex. supports points is a List of Point records
    yValues = List.map .y points
- records are immutable
- to create a new record from an existing one
  * where a field value is changed,
    { rec | key = value }
  * where multiple field values are changed
    { rec | key1 = value1, key2 = value2, ... }
    ex.
    person1 = { name = "Mark", age = 56, tall = True }
    person2 = { person1 | age = 19, tall = False }
- new record shares memory for common fields with old one
- can use pattern matching in function parameters to extract field values
  * like JavaScript object destruturing
  * ex.
    nextAge {age} = age + 1 -- can extract more than one field
    age = nextAge person1 -- 57
- type aliases are often created for record types
- Are there other differences between JavaScript objects and Elm records?

Other Builtin Types
- Array - fast, immutable, all elements must have same type
- Basics - a collection of functions that are imported by default
  * all the operators
  * math functions and constants
  * and much more
- Bitwise
- Char - functions for working with characters
- Color
- Date - for working with dates
- Debug - for logging to browser console
- Dict - Elm version of JavaScript Map
- Json - for encoding and decoding JSON data
- List - described in its own section later
- Maybe - represents optional things like function arguments and object fields
- Platform - 
- Process
  * spawn creates a light-weight process
  * send sends a message to it
  * kill kills it
- Random - supports created many kinds of "generators", including random numbers
- Regex - for working with regular expressions
- Result - described in its own section later
- Set - for working with sets of unique values
- String - described in its own section later
- Task - described in its own section later
- Times - for working with times
  * every function is similar to JavaScript setInterval
- Tuple - described in its own section later

Type Aliases
- give a name to a type definition
- useful for long type definitions that are used multiple times
- syntax: type alias TypeName = type definition
- can be used as a function (called a "record constructor")
  to create an instance
- ex. type alias Person = { name: String, age: Int, tall: Bool }
- person = Person "Mark" 56 True

Union Types
- a.k.a. tagged unions
- can define an enum (see below)
- options can have associated data
- ex. type Time = Noon | Midnight | Hour Int
- creates a constructor for each option
- to use:
  meetingTime : Time
  meetingTime = Noon
  meetingTime = Hour 10
- Hour is a function that takes an Int and returns a Time

Enums
- syntax to define: type EnumName = EnumVal1 | EnumVal2 | ...
- one use is for messages passed to update
- messages can have associated data
- ex. type Msg = SayHello String | Multiply Int

Conditonals
- syntax: if condition then expression else expression
- type of condition must be Boolean
- the else expression can be another condition
  for nested if-then-elses
- there is no ternary operator, only this

let Expressions
- set variables that can be used in "in" expression
- indentation sensitive
- often used as the last or only expression in a function body
- ex.
  msIn : Int -> Int -- maybe can't enter this in repl
  msIn hours =
    let
      minutes : Int -- optional type declaration
      minutes = hours * 60
      seconds : Int -- optional type declaration
      seconds = minutes * 60
    in
      seconds * 1000
  answer = msIn 2 -- 7,200,000
- value of "let" expression is value of last expression after "in"

case Expressions
- ex.
  case expression of
    value1 -> result1
    value2 -> result2
    ...
    _ -> defaultResult
- must handle all possible cases
- cases can include variables used for pattern matching
  against union types that have data
- after each ->, the last line evaluated
  becomes the value of the case expression

Functions
- defining syntax: name parameters = expression
  * ex. product x y = x * y
- calling syntax: name arguments
  * ex. product 2 3
- the value of the last expression evaluated is returned
  * there is no "return" keyword
- calling with fewer arguments than expected results in
  a new function that expects the remaining arguments
  * ex. product 2 3 is the same as (product 2) 3

Anonymous Functions
- definition starts with \ because it looks a little like the lambda symbol
- ex. \x y -> x * y
- to assign a name: product = \x y -> x * 7
- this is just another way to write: double x y = x * y

Function Application Operators
- copied from F#
- useful to avoid the need for parentheses
- someFn <| arg is the same as someFn arg
- arg |> someFn is the same as someFn arg
- ex.
  double x = x * 2
  decrement x = x - 1
  triple x = x * 3
  v = double (decrement (triple 2)) -- 10
  v = double <| decrement <| triple 2 -- 10
  v = 2 |> triple |> decrement |> double -- 10
- more complicated example
  * get the sum of mileage for runs of 20 miles or more
  total = List.sum
    (List.filter (\n -> n >= 20)
     (List.map .distance runs))
  or
  total = runs
    |> List.map .distance
    |> List.filter (\n -> n >= 20)
    |> List.sum

Function Composition Operators
- << applies/composes functions from right to left
  ex.
  recipe = double << decrement << triple
  recipe 2 -- 10
- >> applies/composes functions from left to right
  ex.
  recipe = triple >> decrement >> double
  recipe 2 -- 10

Infix Operators
- can define custom infix operators
- this seems like a bad idea from a readability standpoint for
  readers of your code that are unaware of your custom infix operators

Currying
- when a function is called with fewer arguments than required,
  it returns a new function that expects the remaining arguments

Function Type Declarations
- place on line before corresponding definition
- ex. name : P1Type -> P2Type -> ... -> ReturnType

White space
- is syntactically significant (like Python)

Importing from packages
- syntax: import pkg-name exposing (item1, item2, ...)
- to expose everything in a package, import pkg-name exposing (..)

Variable Declarations
- appear on line before assignment
- ex. assuming a type def for Task
- task : Task
- task = { description: "buy milk", done: False }
- new values cannot be assigned after initial assignment,
  so they are really like constants

Linked Lists
- ex. type IntList = Empty | Node Int IntList
- note that this type definition is recursive
- to create an instance,
  numbers : IntList
  numbers = Node 1 (Node 2 (Node 3 Empty))
  * parens are necessary in to use the result of a function call
    as an argument another function
    * other ways to write this include
      numbers = Node 1 <| Node 2 <| Node 3 Empty
      numbers = Node 3 Empty |> Node 2 |> Node 1
- can use recursion to process all elements
- ex.
  product : IntList -> Int
  product values =
    case values of
      Empty -> 1
      Node value rest -> value * product rest
- linked list that holds values of any type using type variable a:
  type LinkedList a = Empty | Node a (LinkedList a)
- this is how the Elm List type is implemented
- the List library operates on List instances
- could implement a binary tree in a similar way

Runtime Errors
- rarely or never see them because the Elm compiler finds them before runtime
- uses type inference and tracks the flow of data in and out of all functions
- Flow provides much of this for JavaScript.

Elm Architecture
- pattern for building web apps
- three parts: model, update, and view
- model is the app state
- update updates the state; takes a message and a model and returns a new model
- view takes a model and returns HTML
  created using functions in the Html package

Html Library
- defines functions that take a list of attributes and a list of children
  and render HTML
- ex. button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
- Elm takes care of mutating the DOM when the model changes
- sub-packages include Html.Attributes and Html.Events

Maybe Data Structure
- avoids errors related to null or undefined values
- definition: type Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
- to create a Maybe value, use the Nothing or Just constructor
- use a case expression to evaluate Maybe values
- often used for optional fields and
  partial functions (only return a value in some cases)
- optional field example: type Person = { name: String, age: Maybe Int }
- to determine if a person can drive,
  canDrive : Person
  canDrive person =
    case person.age of
      Nothing -> False
      Just age -> age >= 16
- Do the types Maybe, Just, and Nothing have to be
  imported from the Maybe module?

Result Data Structure
- indicates an error is possible and requires handling them
- ex. parsing JSON
- definition: type Result error value = Err error | Ok value
- alternative to throwing which is done in many other languages

Task Data Structure
- similar to Result, but for asynchronous operations like HTTP requests
- look for a description in the main website docs

JavaScript Interop
- allows Elm to be gradually added to an existing JS project
- allows Elm programs to use JS libraries
- can embed Elm code in HTML and communicate with JavaScript
  by passing messages in both directions
- done with "ports" and "flags".
- send values from Elm to JS with a command (Cmd).
- receive values from JS to Elm with a subscription (Sub).

JSON Decoding
- import Json.Decode exposing (..)
  result = decodeString int "19"
  result = decodeString float "3.14159"
  result = decodeString bool "true"
- these result a Result value
- can combine these primitive decoders to decode various data structures
  using the list and field functions
- also see the NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline library
- in addition to conversion, decoders can be used for validation

Modules
- organize code into separate files that can be imported by others
- first line must be:
  module name exposing (item1, item2, ...)
- then define the items being exposed
- convention is to name file the same as the module
- ex. module Foo goes in Foo.elm
- a file without the "module" line will get this by default:
  module Main exposing (..)
- Why is this a good idea for the default?
- to use a module defined on one file in another file:
  import ModuleName
- to use items exposed by that module, precede their names with "ModuleName."
- this is called a "qualified name"
- to choose a different name, perhaps shorter, by which to refer to the module
  import ModuleName as NewName
- to allow use of unqualified names, add use of "exposing"
- ex. import MyModule exposing (myItem1, MyItem2)

elm-package.json
- file in the project root directory
- similar to Node's package.json
- "dependencies" lists the packages on which the project depends
- "source-directories" lists the directories elm-make will search
  for .elm files
- typically have "source-directories": ["src"]
- typically compile by running "elm-make src/Main.elm"
- module names containing dots like Foo.Bar.Baz
  should be found in the file src/Foo/Bar/Baz.elm
