# Swift Notes

## Things I Don't Like

- There are too many ways to do the same thing.

- It uses a string interpolation syntax that is
  different from all other programming languages.

- Using a "dot" in case values is weird.

- Using [ ] for both literal arrays and literal objects is weird.

- "switch" statements can't switch on numbers.

- It still has some Objective-C baggage.

- Enums can inherit protocols and have methods.  That's weird.

- Swift stack traces are really ugly.

- Class extension seems like a bad idea.

- Using {... in ...} to define an anonymous function seems weird.

- Guards seem weird.

## Questions

- Why are structs passed by value (copy)?

- Why can structs have methods just like classes?

- When would you use a struct instead of a class?

- If "let" is for defining constants
  and "var" is for defining variables,
  why is "let" used to define fields in a class
  that can be modified?
