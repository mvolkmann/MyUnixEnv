AngularJS Notes

Download
- from http://angularjs.org
- will get angular.min.js
- include script tag for that or include with RequireJS
  * using RequireJS with AngularJS seems problematic and not common

Documentation
- the primary documentation is on the main site, http://angularjs.org
  under Develop ... API Reference
  * contains documentation on directives, filters, services, types,
  angular functions (global APIs), and more

Applications
- represented by a module object
  * see the "Module" section for how to create
- add ng-app attribute to html tag of main page
  to make it an AngularJS application
  * ex. <html ng-app="module-name">
    - assigning an module name is optional
    - it is useful for sharing data between controllers
- include script tag for angular.min.js
  * this includes jqLite, a lite version of jQuery
- considering including link and script tags for Twitter Bootstrap
  * depends on jQuery

Directives
- encapsulate logic for custom HTML tags, attributes, classes and comments
- there are many provided directives
  * most of their names begin with "ng-"
- when using as attributes, can precede name with "data-"
  to satisfy HTML validators
- adding the ng-model attribute to an input element
  adds its value as a property on $scope
  * $scope is like the data model for the current controller and view
- can iterate over scope array values to create multiple elements
  * ex. <li ng-repeat="person in team">{{person.name}}</li>
- to define a custom directive,
  myApp.directive('name', function () {
    return {
      // properties such as restrict, replace and template go here
    };
  });
- to execute a directive in JavaScript code,
  var element = $compile('custom-tag-goes-here');
  * $compile renders custom tags defined by directives
  * does the $compile service have to be injected?
- ng-animation is a new directive that supports view swap animations
- ng-click directive specifies JavaScript code to execute
  when the element is clicked, not just a function name
  * can add functions to $scope in controller and call those

Models
- hold data
- can have methods
- can bind to an input
  * ex. <input type="text" ng-model="address.city"/>
  * this sets the "address" property of $scope
- can set to a literal value on any element
  * ex. <div ng-init="names=['Mark', 'Tami']">
  * value can be an JavaScript literal value including primitives,
    arrays, objects and nested arrays and objects
- model references should always contain a dot
  * part before dot maps to model object ($scope in controller functions)
  * part after dot is the name of the property
    that will be set on the model object
- scopes can be nested by using the same name before the dot
  in the ng-model attribute of nested elements

Bindings
- expressions inside {{ }}
  * ex. {{address.city}}
  * this gets the "address" property of $scope
- can appear anywhere in HTML anywhere text can appear,
  including in attribute values
- can access scope properties
- can invoke scope methods
- can invoke an JavaScript functions
- cannot contain conditional logic
- updates whenever referenced model properties change
- TODO: How does it know to call model methods again?

Modules
- to create a module
  * var myApp = angular.module('MyApp', []);
    - the empty array is for module dependencies, similar to RequireJS
- jqLite functions are on the angular.element object
- to use a module, specify its name in the ng-app directive
  * ex. <html ng-app="MyApp">

Controllers
- include script tag for JavaScript file that defines a controller function
- write a constructor function with the same name as the controller
  * ex.
  function MyCtrl($scope) { // parameter name must be $scope
    // Set properties on $scope.
    $scope.foo = 1; // can set to any value including objects and arrays

    // Add methods to $scope.
    // These can access scope properites and can have parameters.
    // Consider not accessing scope properties and
    // passing them as parameters when called from bindings instead
    // to make them easier to test.
    $scope.bar = function () { return 2; }
  }
- controllers can also be associated with a module
  * ex. myApp.controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope) { ... });
- associate controller with an element
  * scopes it to that element and its descendants
  * ex. <div ng-controller="MyCtrl"> ... </div>
  * inside binding expressions, access properties and call functions
    assigned to the scope
    - ex. {{$scope.foo + $scope.bar()}}
- properties of $scope are set in controllers and accessed in views
  * controllers and views communicate through a shared $scope value

Views
- views can be defined by script templates or template URLs
- view HTML gains access to the $scope of a controller
  through the ng-controller attribute directive
- ex. <div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
- this association can be made less direct with routes
- to add a view to a page
  <div ng-view="name">...</div>
  * can also use ng-view element
- to create a link that displays the view for a specific route
  <a href="#/route-path">Go To Other View</a>

Config
- a module can have a config function that defines routes
- routes are associated with a view and a controller

Routes
- defined by the module config method
- use browser history to enable use of back and forward buttons
- ex.
  myApp.config(fucntion ($routeProvider) { // injected parameter
    $routeProvider
      .when('/', {
        controller: 'ctrl-name',
        templateUrl: 'name.html'
      })
      .when('/path/:name', { // :name matches a path part
        controller: 'ctrl-name',
        templateUrl: 'name.html'
      })
      .otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
      });
  });


Sharing data between controllers
* get the app object
  var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []); // array is for dependencies
* create a service
  - it is convention for service names to start uppercase
  myApp.factory('ServiceName', function () {
    return {
      // define service properties and methods here
    };
  });
* change controller constructor functions to accept service object
  as second argument
  function MyCtrl($scope, ServiceName) {
    // Make service available in the scope of this controller.
    $scope.serviceName = ServiceName;
  }
* more than one controller can use the same service object to share data

Filters
- functions that transform data
- several are provided
- factor out formatting from application logic
- can pipe data to filters inside binding expressions
  * ex. {{address.city | toUpper}}
- there is a filter named "filter"
  * ex. <li np-repeat="person in team | filter:myFilter | orderBy: 'age'">{{ person.name }}</li>
  * this filters on the value of all properties in the person objects
    using a case-insensitive comparison
  * myFilter is the ng-model value of an input
    where the user can type to filter the data
  * myFilter can be replaced by an object to filter on multiple, specific properties
  * myFilter can be the name of a function that returns true for objects that pass the filter
- can access in JavaScript code with
  var toUpper = $filter('toUpper');
- to define a custom filter
  myApp.filter('toUpper', function () {
    return function (input) {
      return input.toUpperCase();
    };
  });
  * the function passed to filter can take a service
    and access the properties and call methods defined on it

Data Access
- typically performed in factories, services and providers
- these differ in the way they create the object that retrieves the data
- to define a factory
  myApp.factory('factory-name', function ($http) {
    var factory = {};
    factory.getPlayers = function () {
      // Can use $http to make Ajax calls.
      return customers; // return a promise if async
    };
    return factory;
  });
- to use a factory
  * add 2nd parameter to controller function (after $scope)
    with name that matches factory name
  * call methods on factory object to get data
- to define a service
  myApp.service('service-name', function ($http) {
    this.getPlayers = function () {
      // Can use $http to make Ajax calls.
      return customers; // return a promise if async
    };
  });
- to use a service
  * not sure if the following is correct
  * add 2nd parameter to controller function (after $scope)
    with name that matches factory name
  * call methods on service object to get data

Hierarchy
- modules call their config method to define routes
- each route has a path, controller and view (templateUrl)
- controllers use factories, services, providers and values
  to get data
- views are specified as HTML templates
  that use direcives, bindings and filters
- $scope is the glue between a controller and a view

Unit Tests
- can test filters, services, ...
- seems to come with some BDD testing framework
  * Is it Jasmine?
- uses inject function to make the thing being tested
  accessible to the test
- avoid mixing application logic with DOM manipulation
  so the application logic is easier to test

Iterating in HTML
- use ng-repeat attribute
- ex.
  <ul ng-repeat="player in team.players">
    <li>{{player.name}}</li>
  </ul>
- can apply a filter
  ex.
  <ul ng-repeat="player in team.players | filter:search">
  where search is the model object for some input
  * filters on the text of all properties in player objects
  * to filter on a specific property, change the input model to be search.prop-name
  * search.$ searches all properties (same as just search?)
