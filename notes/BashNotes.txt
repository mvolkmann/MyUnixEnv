Bash Shell Notes

Arithmetic expressions
- to assign a number to a variable use "var=$((value))" or "let var=value"
- many assignment operators are supported including =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Assignment
- environment variable
  export name=value
- shell variable
  name=value (no spaces around =)
- dynamic name
  n=5
  eval v$n=19
  # The shell variable v5 is now set to 19.

Command recall
- to recall a past command based on any text in it,
  press ctrl-r and type some of the text
- press return to excute it
- press ctrl-c to abort it

Command-line arguments
- number of them is in $#
- array of them is in $*
- individual arguments are in $1, $2, ...
- $0 is the name of the program being run, not a command-line argument
- testing
  if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "usage: ..."
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ "$1" == "some-value" ]; then
    ...
  fi

Command-line prompts
- PS1 is the normal prompt
- PS2 is the continuation line prompt
- PS3 is the prompt used by the select command

Command-line shortcuts
- !foo - run the most recent command that started with "foo"
- ^foo^bar - replace "foo" with "bar" in the previous command and run it

Files
- to get the part of a file path after the directory path,
  bn=`basename $filePath`
- to loop through files
  for file in *.xml
  do
    # Use file here.
  done

Functions
- syntax to define
  function fn-name {
    # Refer to parameters with $1, $2, ...
  }
  * parameters are not listed inside the parens after the function name
  * empty parens after the function name are optional
- syntax to call
  fn-name p1 p2 ...
  * parameters are not in parens and are not separated by commas
- to return before reaching the end,
  use the "return" keyword which can be followed by a return value
  (if not, the status of the last command executed is returned)

if statements
- syntax
  if [ condition ]; then
    {statements}
  elif [ condition ]; then
    {statements}
  else
    {statements}
  fi
- to negate a condition,
  if [ ! condition ] ...
- to test whether a variable is set
  if [ -n "$name" ]; then
    {statements}
  fi
- to test whether a variable is NOT set
  if [ -z "$name" ]; then
    {statements}
  fi
- to test more than one thing in a condition
  use -a for and and -o for or
  * inside double brackets [[ ]], use && and ||

Regular Expressions
- just strings with no slashes surrounding them
- evaluate with value-to-test =~ regular-expression
- example:
  value="foobarbaz"
  re = "az$"
  if [[ $value =~ $re ]]; then
    echo "matched"
  fi

Scripts
- begin with #!/bin/bash

Status
- the status of the last command is stored in $?
- success is zero
- to test the status of the last command and exit if bad
  if (( $? != 0 )); then exit 1; fi

Strings
- surrounded by double quotes

Tests
- to test if a file exists
  if [ -f "file-path" ]; then
    ...
  fi

Variables
- to assign a value to a variable
  name=value (note no spaces)
- to reference a variable
  $name

vi command-line editing
- add "set -o vi" to startup script
- press esc to enter command mode
