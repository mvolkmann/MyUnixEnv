# 11ty Notes

## Overview

11ty is "a simple static style generator" (SSG).

An 11ty project can be configured to work with
existing content files and an existing directory structure.

A lot of big names in the web community love 11ty, including
Mathias Bynens, Chris Coyier, Brian Leroux, Addy Osmani, Sara Soueidan
See https://www.11ty.dev/docs/testimonials/.

11ty competes with:

- Gatsby (React)
- Hugo (Go)
- Jekyll (Ruby)
- Next (React)
- Nuxt (Vue)
- Sapper (Svelte)
- and more

11ty supports many templating languages (11) including:

- EJS in .ejs files
- Haml in .haml files
- Handlebars in .hbs files
- HTML in .html files
- JavaScript in .11ty.js files
- JavaScript Template Literals in .jstl files
- Liquid in .liquid files
- Markdown in .md files
- Mustache in .mustache files
- Nunjucks in .njk files
- Pug in .pug files

It does not currently support AsciiDoc.

An 11ty site can be built from source files
that use a combination of templating languages.

The build process requires Node, but sites generated by 11ty
do not require downloading any JavaScript code.
Serving only prebuilt pages provides great site performance.
JavaScript code can optionally be included for dynamic functionality.

A great tutorial video by Kyle Mitofsky can be found at

## Starter Themes

There are many free and commercial themes
that can be used as starting points and customized.
Google for "free Bootstrap theme" or "free HTML template".
Search sites like [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/),
[ThemeHunt](https://themehunt.com/),
and [ThemeHut](https://themehut.blogspot.com/).
One example is [Flat Theme Lite](https://themehunt.com/item/1524965-flat-theme-lite-free-responsive-multipurpose-site-template).

## Steps to create an 11ty site

This example uses Markdown and Nunjucks.

1. Create project directory.
1. Enter `npm init`.
1. Enter `npm i @11ty/eleventy`.
1. Create an `index.md` file.

   ```md
   # Mark Volkmann's Blog
   ```

1. Create an `about.md` file.

   ```md
   # About Mark Volkmann

   Mark is a software engineer at Object Computing, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri.
   ```

1. Optionally build the site by entering `npx eleventy`.
   This creates a `_site` directory containing HTML files.
   `index.md` -> `index.html`
   `about.md` -> `about/index.html`

1. Build and serve the site locally
   with hot reloading using BrowserSync by entering
   `npx eleventy --serve`.

1. Browse localhost:8080 and localhost:8080/about.

If the project is placed in a Git repository,
add `_site/` to the `.gitignore` file
since that only contains generated code.

## Deploying 11ty sites

An 11ty site can be published to a server
by copying the contents of the `_site` directory
to the server.

A service like Netlify or Zeit NOW can be used
to associate a site repository so
the site is rebuilt and deployed on every push.

## Layouts

To define layouts that are used for multiple pages:

1. Create a `_includes` directory to hold configuration files
   for layouts and more.

1. Create the file `layout.njk` in this directory.
   This uses the Nunjucks templating language, but others can be used.
   The Nunjucks library does not need to be installed.
   For details on Nunjucks syntax, see
   [Nunjucks Templating](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
   It's a pretty extensive language!

   ```njk
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles.css" />
   </head>
   <body>
    <h1>Mark Volkmann's Blog</h1>
    <nav> <!-- for page navigation -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <h2>{{title}}</h2>
    <!-- content is where page content is injected -->
    <!-- safe causes the HTML content to be sanitized -->
    {{content | safe}}
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. Add the following "front matter" to the beginning of each content file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: layout.njk
   title: {the page title}
   ---

   ```

   Any number of pages can use the same layout file
   and a site can use any number of layout files.

   `title` is like a variable that can be used in the layout.

A layout can extend another layout.
What does this mean?

## Styling

1. Create an `assets` directory.
   The name isn't significant.

1. Create the file `styles.css` inside it
   with content like the following:

   ```css
   nav {
     background-color: cornflowerblue;
     color: white;
   }

   li {
     margin-right: 1rem;
   }

   ul {
     display: flex;
     list-style: none;
     padding: 0.5rem;
   }
   ```

1. Create a `.eleventy.js` file at the top of the project with the following content:

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  // This causses the build process to
  // copy the assets directory to _site.
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy('assets');
};
```
