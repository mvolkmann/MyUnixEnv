# 11ty Notes

## Static site generators (SSGs)

SSGs are an alternative to CMS tools (like WordPress and Drupal)
and graphical site builders (like Squarespace and Wix).

The primary benefits of SSGs are:

- Static sites provide excellent runtime performance.
- Static sites are more secure because all API interactions
  occur during site generation, not when users interact with the site.
  This means there is less of a chance that server hacking
  can affect the content of a site.
- The supported markup/templating options are typically
  easier to write and understand than HTML.
- Development of an SSG site can start from
  a pre-built site to speed development.

See [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/) for a list
of SSGs that can be sorted on various criteria.

Key differentiators between SSGs include:

- supported template languages (Angular, EJS, Go, Haml,
  Handlebars, HTML, JavaScript, Liquid, Markdown, Marko,
  Mustache, Nunjucks, Pug, React, Swig, Twig, Vue, ...)
- the implementation language (Go, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, ...)
  which affects your ability to customize the software
- ability to configure the SSG to use
  existing content files and directory structures
- license (Apache-2.0, Jinja2, MIT, ...)

## 11ty overview

11ty is "a simple static style generator" (SSG).
It is targeted at building static "sites", not web "apps".
11ty is mostly written and maintained by Zach Leatherman.
It is implemented in JavaScript.

TODO: What is the origin of its name?

The 11ty mascot is a possum attached to a helium balloon.

11ty is the most popular SSG that supports multiple template languages.

A lot of big names in the web community love 11ty, including
Mathias Bynens, Chris Coyier, Brian Leroux, Addy Osmani, Sara Soueidan
See https://www.11ty.dev/docs/testimonials/.

11ty competes with:

- Gatsby (React)
- Hugo (Go)
- Jekyll (Ruby)
- Next (React)
- Nuxt (Vue)
- Sapper (Svelte)
- and more

11ty supports many markup languages including:

- HTML in .html files
- Markdown in .md files

11ty supports many templating languages including:

- [Embedded JavaScript (EJS)](https://ejs.co/) in `.ejs` files
- [Haml](http://haml.info/) in `.haml` files
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) in `.hbs` files
- JavaScript in `.11ty.js` files
- JavaScript Template Literals in `.jstl` files
- [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) in `.liquid` files
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) in `.mustache` files
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) in `.njk` files (by Mozilla)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) in `.pug` files

11ty does not currently support AsciiDoc.

An 11ty site can be built from source files that use
a combination of markup and templating languages.

An 11ty project can be configured to work with
existing content files and an existing directory structure.
It looks for template files in all project directories
and outputs `.html` files in the `_site` directory (by default)
with the same directory structure.

The build process requires Node, but sites generated by 11ty
do not require downloading any JavaScript code.
Serving only prebuilt pages provides great site performance.
JavaScript code can optionally be included for dynamic functionality.

## Markdown

Markdown is a syntax for specifying HTML in a simpler way.
It was created by John Gruber and is
defined [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

There are many Markdown parsers.
The one that 11ty uses by default is
[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

Let's review the most commonly used parts of Markdown syntax.

- **headers**: `#` (h1) to `######` (h6)

- **italic**: `*text*` or `_text_`
- **bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- **bold and italic**: `**_text_**` or `__*text*__`
- **strikethrough**: `~~text~~`

- **block quotes**: precede each line with `>`; text is automatically wrapped

- **code in a line**: surround with single backticks
- **code on multiple lines**: surround with lines containing three backticks; follow first line of backticks with a language identifier; ex. `---js`

- **horizontal rule**: three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores;
  each produces the same result

- **HTML**: can include most HTML tags

- **image**: `![alt-text](url)`
- **image with tooltip**: `![alt-text](url "tooltip")`

- **link displaying url**: `<url>`
- **link displaying text**: `[text](url)`
- **link displaying text with tooltip**: `[text](url "tooltip")`

- **unordered list**: precede each list item with `*`, `-`, or `+`
- **ordered list**: precede each list item with `1.`
  or uses a specific number to begin there

  - lists of any type can be nested by indenting two spaces

- **tables**

  ```md
  | Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 | Heading 4 |
  | --------- | :-------- | --------: | :-------: |
  | data 1-1  | data 1-2  |  data 1-3 | data 1-4  |
  | data 2-1  | data 2-2  |  data 2-3 | data 2-4  |
  ```

  Colons in second line indicate horizontal alignment of a column.
  Column 1 is left-aligned by default.
  Column 2 is explicitly left-aligned.
  Column 3 is right-aligned.
  Column 4 is centered.

  Even if the column values are not aligned in the Markdown,
  a properly aligned table will be produced.
  Each heading must have at least three dashes below it.
  The outer pipes can be omitted.
  The VS Code markdownlint extension automatically fixes all these issues.

- **escaping**: precede characters with `\`

### GitHub extensions

- @ mention: `@github-username`
- emoji: `:emoji-name:`;
  examples include `:+1:` (thumbs up), `:tada:` (party hat), and `:rocket:`
- issue reference: `#issue-number`
- task list:
  - `- [ ] some uncompleted task`
  - `- [x] some completed task`

## Templating language choice

The default templating language available for use in Markdown files is Liquid.
Liquid was created by Shopify.
It is implemented in Ruby.

Another popular option is Nunjucks.
It was created by Mozilla and is implemented in JavaScript.
Nunjucks is very similar to Liquid.
Much of the syntax is identical.
But Nunjucks has many features that are not present in Liquid.
For more details on Nunjucks, see your notes file `NunjucksNotes.md`.

To enable the use of Nunjucks in a particular Markdown file,
add the following front matter:

```yaml
templateEngineOverride: njk,md
```

To enable using Nunjucks in all Markdown files,
do one of the following in `.eleventy.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  markdownTemplateEngine: 'njk'
};
```

or

```js
module.exports = eleventyConfig => {
  // Call methods on eleventyConfig here.

  return {
    markdownTemplateEngine: 'njk'
  };
};
```

## Starter Themes

There are many free and commercial themes
that can be used as starting points and customized.
Google for "free Bootstrap theme" or "free HTML template".
Search sites like [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/),
[ThemeHunt](https://themehunt.com/),
and [ThemeHut](https://themehut.blogspot.com/).
One example is [Flat Theme Lite](https://themehunt.com/item/1524965-flat-theme-lite-free-responsive-multipurpose-site-template).

## Steps to create an 11ty site

This example uses Markdown and Nunjucks.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Create a project directory and `cd` to it.
1. Enter `npm init` and answer questions.
1. Enter `npm i @11ty/eleventy`.
1. Create an `index.md` file.

   ```md
   # Mark Volkmann's Blog
   ```

1. Create an `about.md` file.

   ```md
   # About Mark Volkmann

   Mark is a software engineer at Object Computing, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri.
   ```

1. Optionally build the site by entering `npx eleventy`.
   This creates a `_site` directory containing HTML files.
   `index.md` -> `index.html`
   `about.md` -> `about/index.html`

1. Build and serve the site locally
   with hot reloading using BrowserSync by entering
   `npx eleventy --serve`.

1. Browse localhost:8080 and localhost:8080/about.

If the project is placed in a Git repository,
add `_site/` to the `.gitignore` file
since that only contains generated code.

Optionally add these npm scripts in `package.json`
that can be used to build and serve the site:

```json
"build": "eleventy",
"clean": "rm -rf _site",
"start": "eleventy --serve"
```

The `eleventy` command outputs:

- a list of each file it produces
- the time it takes to execute JavaScript functions that retrieve data
- the total time taken to build the site.

If the `--serve` option is used,
it also outputs local and external URLs for
the 11ty server and the BrowserSync admin page.

Including the `--quiet` option suppresses
the list of files produced and the time to execute JavaScript functions.

For help on other options, enter `npx eleventy --help`.

## Deploying 11ty sites

An 11ty site can be published to a server
by copying the contents of the `_site` directory
to the server.

A service like Netlify or Zeit NOW can be used
to associate a site repository so
the site is rebuilt and deployed on every push.

TODO: Show the steps to deploy an 11ty site to GitHub Pages which is free.
TODO: Consider converting your website to do this.

## Front matter

Files processed by 11ty can begin with front matter.
This begins with a line containing only three dashes
and ends with the same kind of line.
Lines between these define variables.
By default this expects YAML syntax.
For example:

```yaml
---
layout: layout.njk
title: Dogs
---

```

To use JavaScript syntax instead, add `js` after the opening dashes.
For example:

```js
---js
{
  layout: 'layout.njk',
  title: 'Dogs'
}
---
```

Strings containing no spaces or special characters do not require quotes.
When quotes are needed, they can be single or double quotes.

Arrays are specified by listing each element preceded by a dash and a space.
For example:

```yaml
colors:
  - red
  - green
  - blue
```

Objects (a.k.a dicts) are lists of key/value pairs
where keys are followed by a color.
For example:

```yaml
address:
  street: 123 Some Lane
  city: Somewhere
  state: CA
  zip: 12345
```

Arrays can hold objects and other arrays..
Object property values can be arrays and other objects.

Variables can be used other files and can represent many kinds of values
including CSS property values, icons, URLs, ...

YAML comments begin with `#` and extend to the end of the line.
Multi-line comments are not supported.

Some special variables recognized by 11ty include:

- layout:
  uses a layout template found in the `_includes` directory
- tags:
  single string or array of collection names to which this data belongs
- date: overrides the default file creation date to change sort order
- pagination:
  enables iteration over data in front matter to
  output multiple HTML files from this template
- permalink:
  changes the output target of the template
- dynamicPermalink:
  enables or disables template syntax in permalink values (default is true)
- templateEngineOverride:
  overrides the template engine used for this file
- eleventyExcludeFromCollections:
  true to exclude this content from collections

TODO: Are there any Nunjucks-specific variables?
TODO: See your front matter question at
TODO: https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/916#issuecomment-583764086.

## Layouts

To define layouts that are used for multiple pages:

1. Create a `_includes` directory to hold configuration files
   for layouts and more.

1. Create the file `layout.njk` in this directory.
   This uses the Nunjucks templating language, but others can be used.
   The Nunjucks library does not need to be installed.
   For details on Nunjucks syntax, see
   [Nunjucks Templating](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
   It's a pretty extensive language!

   ```njk
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles.css" />
   </head>
   <body>
    <h1>Mark Volkmann's Blog</h1>
    <nav> <!-- for page navigation -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <h2>{{title}}</h2>
    <!-- content is where page content is injected -->
    <!-- safe causes the HTML content to be sanitized -->
    {{content | safe}}
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. Add the following "front matter" to the beginning of each content file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: layout.njk
   title: {the page title}
   ---

   ```

   Any number of pages can use the same layout file
   and a site can use any number of layout files.

   `title` is like a variable that can be used in the layout.

A layout can extend another layout.
What does this mean?

## Copying files to output

Some kinds of files do not require processing by 11ty,
but need to be copied to the `_site` directory
when the site is built.
These include CSS and image files.

One way to achieve this is to place all of these files
in subdirectories below a directory named `assets`.
For example, this can have subdirectories named `css` and `images`.

Add the following in `.eleventy.js` to cause 11ty
to copy the `assets` directory to `_site` when the site is built.

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy('assets');
};
```

## Styling

To add CSS styling, configure the build process as shown above
and create `.css` files in the `assets/css` directory.

For example, to style nav links:

```css
nav {
  background-color: cornflowerblue;
  color: white;
}

li {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

One way to use the `.css` files is to add `link` tags in layout files.
Each layout file can include different `.css` files.
For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/layout.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/about.css" />
```

Another approach is the set a variable in template files
whose value is the path to a CSS file.
The variable can be used in a layout to include a `link` tag to the CSS file.
This allows each page template to include a different CSS file.

For example, a template can have this front matter:

```yaml
css: '/assets/css/about.css'
layout: layout.njk
```

A layout can use the variable like this:

```njk
{% if css %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{css}}" />
{% endif %}
```

There is no need to "scope" CSS to specific pages since each page
is built separately and loaded separately into the browser.

## Collections

Collections are defined by specifying tags in front matter.
They are represented by an array of objects
whose properties are the non-tag front matter values.
For example, documents that each describe a specific dog
can have front matter similar to the following.

```yaml
tags: dog,
name: dasher,
breed: whippet
```

Multiple tags can be specified by listing them
in square brackets separated by commas.
This allows the data from a template to be in more than one collection.
For example, `tags: ['dog', 'pet']`.
TODO: are the single quotes required here?

All templates can access `collections.dog` to
iterate over all the data related to dogs.

For example:

```js
{%- for dog in collections.dog -%}
  <p>{{ dog.data.name}} is a {{dog.data.breed}}.</p>
{%- endfor -%}
```

Note the use of `.data` to access the variables specified for a dog.

A layout can specify tags that become the default tags
for all pages that use the layout.
These can be overridden by specifying a different value for `tags` in a page.

For more information on 11ty collections,
see [collections](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/).

## Collection sorting

Collections are sorted on the creation date of their documents.
To iterate over a collection in a different order,
add code in `.eleventy.js` that adds
a new collection that is sorted in the desired way.

For example:

```js
eleventyConfig.addCollection('dogsByName', collection => {
  // Get only the documents that have a tag of "dog".
  const dogs = collection.getFilteredByTag('dog');
  // Sort the dogs on their name.
  dogs.sort((dog1, dog2) => dog1.data.name.localeCompare(dog2.data.name));
  return dogs;
});
```

Use the collection `dogsByName` in a `for` loop
to iterate in the new sorted order.

## Data Cascade

Data in an 11ty project is held in variables.
These variables can be defined in multiple places, and
the "cascade" defines which definition takes precedence.

The places where variables can be defined,
from highest to lowest precedence, include:

- `{template-name}.{markup-extension}` in front matter
- front matter in layouts used by the template
- `{template-name}.11tydata.js` file in same directory
- `{template-name}.11tydata.json` file in same directory
- `{dir-name}.11tydata.js` file in same directory
- `{dir-name}.11tydata.json` file in same directory
- `{dir-name}.11tydata.js` files in ancestor directories
- `{dir-name}.11tydata.json` files in ancestor directories
- `{data-name}.js` file in the `_data` directory
- `{data-name}.json` file in the `_data` directory

Directory files that are closer to a template file
take precedence over those higher in the directory hierarchy.
TODO: It seems layout front matter is given the lowest precedences,
TODO: but that does not match the docs.
TODO: See this issue you created: https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/915

Let's walk through a comprehensive example to demonstrate
all the possible sources of data for a template.
Consider the following directory structure.
Each of these files define an array of dogs.
Any one of them can be used as the source of this data.
The files are numbered to indicate their precedence in
providing data used in `dogs.md` with 1 being the highest.

- \_includes
  - layout.njk (10)
- \_data
  - dogs.js (8)
  - dogs.json (9)
- level1
  - level1.11tydata.js (6)
  - level1.11tydata.json (7)
  - level2
    - dogs.11tydata.js (2)
    - dogs.11tydata.json (3)
    - level2.11tydata.js (4)
    - level2.11tydata.json (5)
    - dogs.md (1)

Here is example content from `_data/dogs.js`.
It exports an array of dogs.

```js
module.exports = [
  {name: 'Dasher', breed: 'Whippet'},
  {name: 'Maisey', breed: 'Treeing Walker Coonhound'},
  {name: 'Ramsey', breed: 'Native American Indian Dog'},
  {name: 'Oscar', breed: 'German Shorthaired Pointer'}
];
```

Here is example content from `_data/dogs.json`.
It defines a value for the global variable `dogs`.

```json
[
  {"name": "Dasher", "breed": "Whippet"},
  {"name": "Maisey", "breed": "Treeing Walker Coonhound"},
  {"name": "Ramsey", "breed": "Native American Indian Dog"},
  {"name": "Oscar", "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer"}
]
```

Here is example content from `level1/level1.11tydata.js`,
`level1/level2/level2.11tydata.js`, and `level1/level2/dogs.11tydata.js`.
They all export an object with a `dogs` property
whose value is an array of dogs.

```js
module.exports = {
  dogs: [
    {name: 'Dasher JS1', breed: 'Whippet'},
    {name: 'Maisey JS1', breed: 'Treeing Walker Coonhound'},
    {name: 'Ramsey JS1', breed: 'Native American Indian Dog'},
    {name: 'Oscar JS1', breed: 'German Shorthaired Pointer'}
  ]
};
```

Here is example content from `level1/level1.11tydata.json`,
`level1/level2/level2.11tydata.json`, and `level1/level2/dogs.11tydata.json`.
They all define an object with a `dogs` property
whose value is an array of dogs.

```json
[
  {"name": "Dasher", "breed": "Whippet"},
  {"name": "Maisey", "breed": "Treeing Walker Coonhound"},
  {"name": "Ramsey", "breed": "Native American Indian Dog"},
  {"name": "Oscar", "breed": "German Shorthaired Pointer"}
]
```

Here is the content of `level1/level2.dogs.md`.
It defines an array of dogs using YAML syntax.

```md
---
dogs:
  - name: Dasher
    breed: Whippet
  - name: Maisey
    breed: Treeing Walker Coonhound
  - name: Ramsey
    breed: Native American Indian Dog
  - name: Oscar
    breed: German Shorthaired Pointer
layout: layout.njk
---

# Dogs

{% for dog in dogs %}
{{dog.name}} is a {{dog.breed}}.
{% endfor %}
```

The set of variables obtained from these sources is merged,
but their values are not.
For example, if a template defines `tags` to be `['dog', 'pet']`
and its layout defines `tags` to be `['canine', 'creature', 'pet']`
the result will be `['dog', 'pet']`.

As another example, consider a template with the following front matter:

```yaml
layout: myLayout.njk
title: 'Template Title'
```

Suppose `myLayout.njk` contains the following front matter:

```yaml
score: 7
title: 'Layout Title'
```

The data available in the template will be:

```js
{
  layout: myLayout.njk,
  score: 7,
  title: 'Template Title'
}
```

## Using data from a REST service

One way to make data from REST services available to templates
is to add `.js` files under the `_data` directory
whose names are the name of a global variable to set.

For example, the global variable `employees` can be set
by creating the file `_data/employees.js`
that uses the Fetch API to call a REST service.
To use the Fetch API, `npm install -d node-fetch`.

This file could contain the following:

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async () => {
  const url = 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees';
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const response = await res.json();
  // This REST service returns an object with the properties
  // success and data where data is an array of employee objects.
  return response.data;
};
```

The employees can be rendered on a page like this:

```njk
{% for employee in employees %}
  <p>{{ employee.employee_name}} is {{employee.employee_age}} years old.</p>
{% endfor %}
```

We can also make data from a REST service available to
only a single template or only templates in and below a given directory.
For example, suppose the file `company/employees.md`
needs access to the employee data.
We can create the file `company/employees.11tydata.js`
or `company/company.11tydata.js` containing the following:

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async () => {
  const url = 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees';
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const response = await res.json();
  // Any number of front matter variables
  // can be included in the returned object.
  return {employees: response.data};
};
```

When a template uses pagination and gets data from a REST service
as shown above, the REST service is invoked once,
then again for each page.
So if pagination results in three pages,
there will be four calls to the REST service.
TODO: Why is this?

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes define snippets of reusable content.
This is the closest thing 11ty provides to components
in web frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.
For example, here is a "dog" shortcode definition
that is define in `.eleventy.js`.

```js
eleventyConfig.addShortcode(
  'dog',
  (breed, name) => `
    <div class="dog">
      <div class="name">Name: ${name}</div>
      <div class="breed">Breed: ${breed}</div>
    </div>
  `
);
```

This definition becomes globally available.
To use it:

```njk
{%- for dog in collections.dogsByName -%}
  {% dog dog.data.breed, dog.data.name %}
{%- endfor -%}
```

## Permalinks

11ty permalinks specified in front matter change
the path of the output files produced within the `_site` directory.
They are useful when the source directory structure
does not match the desired output directory structure.

When permalinks are specified,
any links to those pages must be updated to match.
Previously generated files under `_site` are not removed
after permalinks are added or modified,
so delete the `_site` directory and build again.

For example, the file `dogs.njk` would normally
generate `_site/dogs/index.html`.
To change this to `_site/animals/canines/index.html`,
add the following front matter in `dogs.njk`:

```yaml
permalink: 'animals/canines/'
```

The trailing slash is required.
Including `index.html` is optional,
but that is the file that is actually created.

An error is reported if multiple files target the same permalink path.

Permalink values can include variable references.
For example:

```yaml
permalink: 'animals/{{species | slug}}'
```

Quotes must surround values that include variable references.
Using the `slug` filter encodes the value to ensure a valid URL.
This filter is provided by 11ty, not Nunjucks.

Permalinks can be used in conjunction with pagination
to change the paths to the files produced for each page.
This is described in the next section.

## Pagination

Pagination is the 11ty term for producing multiple files from one input file.
It operates on an array of data.
The `size` variable specifies the number of
array elements to be rendered on each page.
Often it is set to 1 to render each element on a separate page.
The array data can come from anywhere in the data cascade.

By default the URL for each page produced ends with a slash and a page number.

For example:

```yaml
pagination:
  data: employees # data over which to paginate
  size: 7 # number of employees per page
```

The global variable `pagination` holds related data.

- `pagination.data` holds the value of the
  pagination `data` property from the front matter.
- `pagination.pages` holds an array of items for each page.
  When the size is one the array holds each page item.
  When the size is greater than one it holds arrays of the items on each page.
  When `data` is an object rather than an array, it holds keys instead of items.
- `pagination.items` is an array of the objects
  to be rendered on the current page.
- `pagination.pages.length` is the number of pages.
- `pagination.pageNumber` holds the zero-based index of the current page.
- `pagination.firstPageLink` holds the URL of the first page (alias `first`).
- `pagination.firstPageHref` is the same, but omits `index.html` at end.
- `pagination.previousPageLink` holds the URL of the previous page (alias `previous`).
- `pagination.previousPageHref` is the same, but omits `index.html` at end.
- `pagination.nextPageLink` holds the URL of the next page; (alias `next`).
- `pagination.nextPageHref` is the same, but omits `index.html` at end.
- `pagination.lastPageLink` holds the URL of the last page (alias `last`).
- `pagination.lastPageHref` is the same, but omits `index.html` at end.
- `pagination.pageLinks` holds an array of all the page links (alias `links`).
- `pagination.href` holds an object with keys
  "previous", "next", "first", and "last" whose values are those hrefs.
- `pagination.hrefs` holds an array of all the page hrefs.

The URL for each page is `/{pagination.data}/{zero-based-index}`.
The URL for the first page page is simply `/{data-name}`.
The URL `/{data-name}/0` is not valid.

`pagination.items` holds the current page item when the size is 1
or an array of the current page items when size is greater than 1.
To add an alias for this add an `alias` property
to the `pagination` front matter.
For example:

```yaml
pagination:
  ...
  alias: items
```

With this alias in place, we can iterate over `items`
instead of `pagination.items` to render all the items on the current page.

To display "Page m of n":

```njk
<div>
  Page {{pagination.pageNumber + 1}} of {{pagination.pages.length}}
</div>
```

To render links to the first, previous, next, and last pages
so each is only rendered when it makes sense:

```njk
<nav class="pagination">
  <ol>
    {% if pagination.pageNumber > 0 %}
      <li><a href="{{pagination.href.first}}">First</a></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if pagination.href.previous %}
      <li><a href="{{pagination.href.previous}}">Prev</a></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if pagination.href.next %}
      <li><a href="{{pagination.href.next}}">Next</a></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if pagination.pageNumber < pagination.pages.length - 1 %}
      <li><a href="{{pagination.href.last}}">Last</a></li>
    {% endif %}
  </ol>
</nav>
```

To render links to all the pages except the current by number:

```njk
<nav class="pagination">
  <ol>
    {% for href in pagination.hrefs %}
      {%if loop.index0 !== pagination.pageNumber %}
        <li><a href="{{href}}">Page {{ loop.index }}</a></li>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ol>
</nav>
```

Note that Nunjucks provides the variable `loop` that holds
an object with the properties `index` (1-based) and `index0` (0-based).
These hold the current loop index.

To style the anchor tags as buttons:

```css
.pagination {
  background-color: transparent;
}

.pagination ol {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0.5rem 0; /* to match "a" padding below */
}

.pagination a {
  border: solid gray 1px;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

To style the anchor for the current page differently that the others,
define a CSS rule for `a.current` and
set the `class` on the `a` elements as follows:

```njk
<a
  class="{{'current' if loop.index0 === pagination.pageNumber else ''}}"
  href="{{href}}"
>
```

To paginate data in reverse order,
add the `reverse` property to the `pagination` front matter.

```yaml
pagination:
  ...
  reverse: true
```

When `data` is an object rather than an array,
the items will be keys instead of items.
To change this so the items are the property values,
add the `resolve` property to the `pagination` front matter.

```yaml
pagination:
  ...
  resolve: values
```

To produce different data to be paginated from existing data,
use the `before` front matter property whose value is
a JavaScript function that takes the data and returns new data.
This can create new data to paginate by filtering, sort, and transforming.
Using this requires all the front matter
to be converted from YAML to JavaScript.
For example, the following filters the employees
so only those age 50 and older are retained
and it makes their names all uppercase:

```yaml
---js
{
  layout: 'employees-layout.njk',
  title: 'Employees',
  pagination: {
    data: 'employees',
    size: 7,
    alias: 'items',
    before(employees) {
      return employees.
        filter(emp => emp.employee_age >= 50).
        map(emp => ({
          ...emp,
          employee_name: emp.employee_name.toUpperCase()
        }));
    }
  }
}
---
```

To change the paths of the files produced for each page, specify a permalink.
For example, if the file `employees.njk` uses pagination then
it would normally generate files like `_site/employees/2/index.html`
where 2 is a page number.
To change this so it generates files like
`_site/workers/group-2/index.html`, add the following front matter:

```yaml
permalink: 'workers/group-{{pagination.pageNumber}}/index.html'
```

## Global data

Global data can be defined in `.js` or `.json` files in the `_data` directory.
When defined in a `.js` file, it should export a function that returns the data.
For example, the file `_data/hockey.js` could contain:

```js
module.exports = () => [
  {city: 'Chicago', name: 'Blackhawks'},
  {city: 'St. Louis', name: 'Blues'}
];
```

TODO: Can the JavaScript code call a REST service to get the data?

To render this data in a template:

```njk
{%- for team in hockey -%}
  <p>The {{team.name}} play in {{team.city}}.</p>
{%- endfor -%}
```

todo: cover details of the .eleventy.js file.

## CMS integration

TODO: How can an 11ty site use assets from a CMS like Strapi?

## Obtaining data from REST services

TODO: Add this.

## Plugins

The functionality of 11ty can be extended with plugins.
These are documented [here](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/).

### Syntax highlighting

Install the plugin.

```bash
npm install -D @11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
```

Modify .eleventy.js:

```js
const syntaxHighlight = require('@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight');
module.exports = eleventyConfig => {
  ...
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(syntaxHighlight);
};
```

Download a Prism theme `.css` file from
[Prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)
and place it in the `assets` directory.
For example, `prism-vs.css`.

Add a `link` tag for this in all layout files whose pages need it.
For example, this can be added in `_includes/layout.njk`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/prism-vs.css" />
```

Surround code to have syntax highlighting with fences.
For example:

````text
 ```js
 code goes here
 ```
````

For more details, see the documentation [here](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/).

There is also a way to trigger syntax highlighting
with Nunjucks, but some editors like VS Code
will change the indentation in code blocks
when using this approach.

### Internationalization

TODO: See https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/multilingual-sites-eleventy/.

```

```

## Debugging tips

To see the content of an array or object,
use the Nunjucks `dump` filter which calls `JSON.stringify`.
For example, `<div>myVariable = {{myVariable | dump}}`.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

The steps to publish an 11ty site to GitHub Pages are:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
1. Create a new GitHub repository for the site.
1. Clone the repository.
1. Add the files from an 11ty project to the repository.
1. Push the changes.
1. In the web UI for the repository, click "Settings" near the upper-right.
1. Enable the repository to be a GitHub Pages site. How?
