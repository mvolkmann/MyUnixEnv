Git Notes

See http://www.gitready.com/ and
http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/

Differences from other version control systems
- it's distributed - no central repository
- tracks contents of files, not files
- filenames are treated like metadata added to content

Tidbits
- local content is stored in a "working tree"
- project directories contain a .git subdirectory
  that holds the local repository (abbreviated as repo from here out)
- "tags" are names that mark a point in time in the history of a repo
- there are over 140 git commands
  * but you won't use most of them
  * many are only used internally by other git commands

Installing
- easy way
  * download a precompiled package from http://git-scm.com
  * double-click the installer
- another way for Linux
  * sudo apt-get build-dep git-core git-doc
  * make prefix=/usr/local all doc
  * sudo make install install-doc
- another way for Mac OS X using MacPorts
  * sudo port install git-core +svn +doc
  * add /usr/local/git/bin to PATH in .bash_profile
- under Windows, running in Cygwin is recommended
  * see the Cygwin package Devel > git: Fast Version Control System
    - four pieces: git, git-completion, git-gui and gitk
  * also need
    - Net > openssh
    - Libs > tcltk (to use Git GUI)
    - an editor such as Vim or emacs (under Editors)
  * could also use the newer MSys fork of Git instead of Cygwin
- to verify that it worked
  * git --version

Configuring
- the --global flag configures options for every repo
- git config --global user.name "R. Mark Volkmann"
- git config --global user.email "mark@ociweb.com"
- git config --global color.ui auto
  * for color-coded output
- git config --list
  * to list configuration settings
- to ignore files with certain extensions from status reports
  * option 1: create a .gitignore file in the top repo directory
    and add a line for each extension to be ignored (ex. .*.swp)
    - can add and commit this file so others get the same excludes
  * option 2: add lines to the file {repo-dir}/.git/info/exclude
  * What are the main differences between these options?

Help
- for top-level help, "git help"
- for command-specific help, enter "git help {command-name}"
- on-line manual at http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs

GUIs
- git gui
- gitk [-all]
  * from a repo directory
  * -all shows all branches; omitting shows only current branch
- GitX for Mac OS X
  * download from http://gitx.frim.nl/
- Git Extensions for Windows
  * http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/

Diffs
- to see diffs between working tree and local repo
  * git diff {file-path}
- to see diffs between local repo and origin repo
  * git diff origin -- {file-path}
- to see diffs between specific commits
  * git diff {commit-1} {commit-2} -- {file-path}
    - where the commits are the first seven characters
    - use git log {file-path} to determine commits
- added lines are preceded with a "+"
- deleted lines are preceded with a "-"
- options for "git log" can also be used with "git diff"
- to see diffs between staging and repo
  * git diff --cached
- to see diffs between working tree and
  last commit on the current branch (HEAD)
  * git diff HEAD
- to see diffs between a given revision and the previous one
  * git diff {revision-number}
  * for commands that take a revision number, it is usually
    sufficient to specify only first seven hex characters
  * when no revision is specified, HEAD is assumed
- to see statistics about changes
  * git diff --stat {tag-or-revision}
  * shows the total number of insertions and deletions in each file
    and graphically indicates the amount of each
    - + for insertions and - for deletions
- for a graphical diff, change "git diff" to "git difftool"

Aliases
- can create aliases for git commands with
  git config --global alias.{alias} "{command}"
  or edit ~/.gitconfig and add them under [alias] section
  * ex.
    [alias]
      br = branch
      ci = commit
      co = checkout

Reporting (log, blame and status)
- to list commits showing author, date and message
  * git log
  * sends output through less if more than one screen
  * add -p to see diffs between revisions
  * add -n{number} to see only the last {number} commits
  * add --before="{date-time-desc}"
    to see only commits before that date/time
  * add --after="{date-time-desc}"
    to see only commits after that date/time
  * example date/time specifications:
    1 minute, 5 hours, 2009-4-16, today, tomorrow
  * add --pretty=oneline to list commits in brief form
  * add a revision range to only list commits
    from the beginning (exclusive) to end (inclusive)
    * ex. git log 18f822e..0bb3dfb
    * omit the end revision but include .. to go all the way to HEAD
    * can use tag names in place of revision names
  * for help on other git log options, enter "git log --help"
- blame is similar to log
  * but it prefixes output lines with
    the commit name, committer and timestamp
  * to limit to a certain set of line numbers, add -L{start},{end}
    - end can be +n or -n for a number of lines from the start
  * to limit to lines that match a given regular expression,
    add -L"/{regex}/"
  * to run on a specific file instead of all,
    add -- {file-name} at the end
- to list files that have been added or changed, but not yet committed
  * git status
    - doesn't list new tags!

Branches
- often used for
  * experimental changes
  * adding new features
  * bug fixes
- default branch is named "master"
  which is the same as trunk in CVS and Subversion
- to create a branch
  * git branch {new-branch-name} [{from-branch-name}]
    - from-branch-name defaults to the current branch
    - by convention, release branches begin with RB,
      followed by _ and a version number
- to switch to a given branch
  * git checkout {branch-name} or @{commit-number}
  * typically you will want to commit any changes before doing this
  * the commit number can be obtained from "git log" or "git reflog"
  * HEAD always points the current branch
- to combine creating a new branch and switching to it
  * git checkout -b {new-branch-name} [{from-branch-name}]
- to see list of all branches
  * git branch [-a|-r]
    - with no options, only local branches are listed
    - with the -r option, only remote branches are listed
    - with the -a option, both local and remote branches are listed
    - the current branch is preceded by an asterisk
- to merge a branch to another, see "Merging" section
- to see list of all branches that have been merged to the current branch
  * git branch --merged
- to see list of all branches that have not been merged to the current branch
  * git branch --no-merged
- to rename a branch (-m for move)
  git branch -m {old-name} {new-name}
  * only works if no branch named {new-name} exists
  * to force overwrite, use -M instead of -m
- to delete a branch
  * often done after a successful merge to another branch
  * git branch -d {branch-name}
    - only works if the branch has already been merged to the current one
    - to force the delete, use -D instead of -d
- to tag a branch
  * git tag {tag-name} [{branch-name}]
    - defaults to tagging the current branch
  * git push --tags
    - without --tags, push doesn't push tags!
- to see latest commit on each branch
  * git branch -v
- short-lived vs. long-lived branches
  * short-lived branches
    - used for a specific set of changes, merged to parent branch,
      and deleted
  * long-lived branches
    - repeatedly make changes on a branch, commit them,
      and merge into parent branch
    - the key is that commits are merged to parent branch more than once
- two categories of branches
  * private, local
    - only used by you
    - exist only in your local repo
    - typically deleted after merged back to master
  * shared, remote
    - used by multiple developers
    - exit in many local repos and the remote repo
    - to create on remote repo
      * git push origin {branch-name}
- example
  # Create repo and populate master branch.
  git init demo
  cd demo
  echo "in a" > a.txt
  echo "in b" > b.txt
  git add *
  git commit -m "first commit"

  # It is best to create a new branch and make changes there
  # rather than on the master branch.  However, suppose the
  # changes are made while master is the current branch and
  # then it is realized that a branch should have been created.
  # This shows how the changes can be committed on a new branch
  # and the master branch can be returned to its last committed state.
  # Make changes, create a branch, and only commit changes on new branch.
  echo "line 2" >> a.txt
  rm -f b.txt
  echo "in c" > c.txt
  git checkout -b branch2
  git add c.txt
  git commit -a -m "second commit"

  # Verify that changes are not present in master branch.
  git checkout master
  cat a.txt
  cat b.txt
  cat c.txt
  # Note that unlink on branch2, on the master branch:
  # - a.txt is back to its original content
  # - b.txt is restored
  # - c.txt is absent

Merging
- can merge two or more branches into one
- three kinds of merges
  * straight - merges all individual commits separately
  * squashed - merges all individual commits as a single commit
  * cherry-picking - merges only a single, selected commit
- to merge one branch into another
  * git checkout {to-branch} # if it isn't already the current branch
  * git merge {from-branch}
  * after a succesful merge, typically you'll want to delete from-branch
    - git branch -d {from-branch}
    - reduces distraction when viewing a list of existing branches
  * can also merge master into the branch to verify that
    changes by others don't break code in the branch
    - after that is verified, merge the branch back to master
  * also consider using the rebase command

Conflicts
- when a merge fails due to conflicts, files with conflicts are listed
- these files will contain conflict markers
- three approaches to resolving conflicts
  * first approach
    - resolve conflicts manually with any text editor
    - stage and commit changes
  * second approach
    - run "git mergetool" which runs a diff tool and stages changes
      * a popular diff tool on Mac OS X is opendiff (part of Xcode)
      * can configure which tool is used by setting merge.tool
    - commit changes
  * third approach
    - delete the local file and
      run "git checkout {file-name}" to get remote version

Tags
- tags mark all the files in the repo at an instant in time
- tag names must be unique across the entire repo
  * they are not scoped to individual branches
- to create a lightweight tag (not annotated)
  * git tag {name}
- to create an annotated tag
  * git tag -a {name}
- to view a list of all tags
  * git tag
- to delete a tag
  * git tag -d {name}
- to create a branch off a tag
  * git branch {tag-name} {new-branch-name}

Archives
- specify what should be archived with an id
  which can be a branch name, tag name or commit id
- to create a gzipped tarball archive
  * git archive --format=tar --prefix={prefix} {id} | \
    gzip > {prefix}.tar.gz
- to create a zip archive
  * git archive --format=zip --prefix={prefix} {id} > {prefix}.zip
- when unzipped, all the files will be a in a new directory named {prefix}

Tab Completion for git commands
- download Git source from http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  * for example, git-1.6.3.rc3.tar.gz
- unzip the source
- copy contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
  to somewhere under your home directory
  * for example ~/bin
- add the following line to your .bash_profile:
  . ~/bin/git-completion.bash
- new Terminal windows will now support tab completion in git commands

GitHub
- to sign up
  * browse http://github.com
  * click the "Pricing and Signup" link
  * click the "Sign Up!" button in the "Open Source/Free!" box
  * enter username, email, password and SSH public key
    - can generate a new SSH public key
      by entering "ssh-keygen" in a Terminal window
      * tell it to save the file in /Users/Mark/.ssh/github
      * this will create two files
        - github contains the private key
        - github.pub contains the public key
    - leave the passphrase empty
    - edit ~/.ssh/config and add the following:
      Host github.com
      HostName github.com
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github
      User git
  * press the "I agree, sign me up!" button
- to create a new repository
  * click the "Create a Repository" link
  * enter project name, description and homepage URL
  * press the "Create Repository" button
  * follow the instructions on the web page that is displayed
    under "Global setup" and "Next steps"
- to add a reference to the remote repository
  * git remote add origin git@github.com:mvolkmann/{repo-name}.git
  * "origin" is the reference name
- to push changes on the local "master" branch to the remote repository
  * git push origin master
- setup so git commands don't prompt for a password (from Steve Veit)
  - ssh-keygen -trsa
  - press enter repeatedly to accept all defaults
  - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  - copy the contents
  - browse github.com
  - select "Account Settings"
  - select "SSH Public Keys"
  - select "Add another public key"
  - enter a value in the "Title" field
  - paste the copied content in the the "Key" field
  - press "Add key"
  - ssh git@github.com
  - enter "yes"
  - you are now permanently authenticated
  - verify that .git/config [remote "origin"] url value
    uses the git protocol, not http or https

To create a clone of another repo
- git clone {repo-url} [{local-repo-name}]
  * local-repo-name defaults to same as remote repo name
- repo-urls typically begin with git://
  * here's an ssh example
    ssh://{your-username}@host/~{owner-username}/path
- a directory to hold the repo will be created by git
- for example:
  git clone git://github.com/weavejester/compojure.git
- can create a "bare" repo
  * doesn't have a working copy
  * stores the files in binary form
  * consumes less space (ex. 9.6 MB versus 38.4 MB)
  * add "--bare" after "git clone"
- can clone a repo to a USB stick
  * for example (in Cygwin):
    cd /cygdrive/e (USB stick; /Volumes/BOEINGUSB on Mac)
    git clone --bare /cygdrive/c/commontypes
      (creates /cygdrive/e/commontypes.git)
    cd /cygdrive/c
    mv commontypes commontypeSAVE (just to be safe)
    git clone /cygdrive/e/commontypes.git
    - /Volumes/BOEINGUSB/commontypes.git on Mac
    - creates /cygdrive/c/commontypes
  * now after committing changes to repo on the C drive,
    enter "git push" to push them to the repo on the E drive
    - if you get an error that says "unpack failed"
      it could be caused by the USB stick being locked (read-only)
  * to pull changes from the repo on the E drive,
    cd to the C drive repo and enter "git pull"
  * can use to keep two machines in sync
    - for example, to create a working repo on a Mac
      git clone /Volumes/VOLKMANNUSB/commontypes.git

To get updates
- cd to the local repo directory
- enter "git pull"
- this performs a fetch and a merge
- there is no "dry run" option for this

To create a repo that will be used as a "master"
- cd to where it will live
- create a new directory for it
- cd to the new directory
- git init --bare --shared
- cd to where a clone will live
- git clone {master-dir-name}
  * git clone ssh://{your-account}@{host}/{remote-repo-dir-path}
    - ex. git clone ssh://{your-account}@141.102.95.154/~volkmarm/master/svcport
  * You'll see the message "warning: You appear to have
    cloned an empty repository.".  That's okay.
- add files to the clone using "git add *" and "git commit"
- git push origin master
  * after this first push you can use "git push"
    without specifying origin and master
- now developers can create clones from this with
  git clone {master-path}
- for more, see
  http://www.jedi.be/blog/2009/05/06/8-ways-to-share-your-git-repository/

To create a new repo
- mkdir {name}
  * this step is optional
  * it is safe to run "git init" in an existing directory
- cd {name}
- git init
- alternatively, "git init {dir-name}" will
  create the directory and create a repo inside it

To stage new and modified files to be added to a local repo
- git add {file-name}+
- git add -i
  * interactive mode
- git add -p (patch mode)
  * to stage changes to portions of modified files
    instead of all the changes
- if a modified file is staged, modified again, and then committed,
  only the staged changes are committed

To unstage files that haven't yet been committed
- git reset HEAD {file-name}+
- HEAD is a synonym for the current branch

To commit changes including added/deleted/moved/modified files
- git commit
  * commits staged files to a local repo
  * will prompt for message using an editor or
    it can be specified on command with -m {message}
  * the editor uses can be configured in several ways
    and defaults to vi
  * can have more than one -m; each creates a separate paragraph
- git commit {file-path}
  * commits a specific file without staging it first
- git commit -a
  * commits all changed files, even if they haven't been staged
- add -v to see commented diffs in the editor
  to assist with creating good commit messages
- add --no-verify to suppress "suspicious commit" messages
  related to "trailing whitespace" which may not appear to be present
- git commit --amend
  * must be run before the last commit is pushed
  * replaces the previous commit with a new one
  * useful when previous commit contained errors that shouldn't be retained
    - ex. to add or delete files to the commit

To move or rename a file
- git mv {old-path} {new-path}
  * new-path can be just a directory
  * keeps history
  * still need to commit after this

To delete files
- git rm {file-path}
- git rm -r {directory-path}

To undo commits
- git revert
  * creates a new commit that matches a given past revision
- git revert -n HEAD
  * reverts files on the current branch to match HEAD

To reset the repo to an earlier state
- git reset
  * deletes unwanted revisions
  * defaults to resetting the current branch to match HEAD
  * add --hard to delete them from both the repository and the working tree
    (How does omitting this differ?)
- git clean -fd
  * deletes finds that git isn't tracking

To host a git server
- the easiest way is to use Gitosis

To fetch changes made in a remote repo, but not merge them
- git fetch (after a git clone)
- updates local information about remote branches,
  but doesn't merge them with local changes
- git fetch + git merge = git pull

To view a specific revision of a file
- git show {revision}:{file-path}
  * ex. git show 1234567:src/com/ociweb/foo/Bar.java
  * note how path is relative to top of repo

To list local branches
- git branch

To list remote branches
- git branch -r

To merge remote, committed changes with the local repo
- git pull [remote-repo [branch]]
  * remote-repo can be a keyword (like origin)
  * branch can be a tag or keyword (like HEAD)

To merge local, committed changes with a remote repo
- git push [remote-repo [branch]]
  * with no arguments, the current branch is merged into
    the same branch in the origin repo

To create a remote repo from a local one that was created with git init
- git remote add {name} {repo-url}
  * makes name an alias for the remote repo
  * name can be origin which is where changes are pushed by default
- git push origin master
  * for initial population

To see a list of remote aliases
- git remote

To see information about a particular alias
- git remote show {alias-name}

To remove an alias
- git remote rm {alias-name}

To revert a file back to the HEAD version
- git checkout HEAD {file-path}
- file-path can be just the file name if in its directory
- also works to undelete a file

To tag the repository at a milestone, such as a release
- git tag {tag-name} [commit-or-branch-name]
  * tags committed files

To list existing tags
- git tag

To get a working tree of files in their state for a given tag
- git checkout {tag-name}

To make changes to files that were checked out from a tag
- create a branch with git checkout -b {branch-name}
- useful for making changes to a release

To find a commit where a bug was introduced
- git bisect run {test-script-path}
- mark one commit older commit as bad and one newer commit as good
- runs tests on each commit between those 
  and automatically marks them as good or bad
- the test script should exit with a zero status if the tests pass
  and a non-zero status otherwise
- seems overkil

Recommended release procedure
- when the code is feature complete, but not finished with testing,
  create a "release branch"
  * naming convention RB_#
- release branches are intended to live only a short time
  during final testing and debugging before an actual release
- when ready to release, create a tag and delete the release branch

To create a branch for fixing bugs in a past release
- git branch RB_# {release-tag}
- git checkout RB_#

After committing fixes
- git tag release_# (creates a release tag)
- git branch -D RB_# (deletes the release branch)

Tag and branch names
- can contain /'s anywhere but the end
  to organize them into directory-like structures
- can contain .'s
- branch names cannot contain spaces, ~, ^, :, ?, * or [

Project to repo mapping
- rule of thumb: store multiple projects in a single repo
  only if they will be released at the same time

To clone a repo and its submodules
- yikes!  too complicated!
- probably shouldn't use submodules

To optimize history storage, occassionally run
- git gc --aggressive

To export a snapshot of the current repo in a tar or zip file
- git archive --format=[tar|zip] --prefix={dir-name}/ HEAD > {file-path}
  * HEAD can be replaced by a tag or branch name
  * when format is tar, add "| gzip" after HEAD to create a .tar.gz file

Changes to all branches are tracked in the "reflog".

To see history
- git log
- git reflog
  * same, but includes revisions that have been removed by a rebase
  * however, git gc can remove those
- both output history in reverse chronological order

To discard changes that haven't yet been committed to your local repo
- git checkout {file-path}
- this replaces the file with the latest version in your local repo
- it may take git a minute or so to realize
  at the file is no longer modified
  even though "git diff" will immediately report no differences

Remote repos
- git can communicate with remote repos using
  * ssh
    - secure
    - username@server/path
      * ex. git@github.com/mvolkmann/VendingMachine-Clojure
  * git
    - a custom protocol designed for speed
    - typically set up to be read-only
    - uses port 9418 which firewalls may block
    - git://server/repo-path
  * http or https
    - least efficient
    - not supported by github
    - most accepted by firewalls
    - http://server/path

Rebasing
- can combine multiple commits into one
- can split one commit into multiple ones
- can reorder commits
- can incorporate changes made in one branch into the current one
  so the changes appear to have been made on the current branch
- when a conflict is detected during a "git rebase"
  there are three options
  * fix them
    - resolve the conflicts
    - git add {file}
    - git rebase --continue
  * git rebase --skip
  * git rebase --abort
- for interactive selection of which commits to squash
  * git rebase -i

Submodules
- allow one repo to store others but keep independent histories
  * you used this for your MyUnixEnv module which includes Vim plugin submodules
- to list submodules, git submodule
- to add a submodule, from top project directory
  * git submodule add {git-url} {dir-path-below-current}
- to populate the files in submodules, from top project directory
  * git submodule init
  * git submodule update
- to remove a submodule, from top project directory
  * see the webpage below ... it's complicated!
- for more detail, see
  http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/

Vim
- if git complains about an error in Vim after entering a commit message,
  do this
  * git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/vim
