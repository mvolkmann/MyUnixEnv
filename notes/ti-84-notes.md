Menus
- many button presses display a menu of options
- select a menu item by pressing the number in front of it or
  move to a menu item with the up and down arrows and press enter
- There are five shortcut menus labeled f1 through f5 on the top row,
  all accessed with the alpha key.
- f1 provides items to enter a fraction (n/d),
  enter a mixed fraction (Un/d),
  convert between these (>n/d<>Un/d), and
  convert between fraction and decimal (>F<>D)
  (apparently nobody knows what the U stands for)
- f2 provides abs, summation, nDeriv, fnInt, logBASE, x root, nPr, nCr, and !
- f3 provides a way to enter a matrix up to 6x6
- f4 provides a way to use a y= equation
- f5 doesn't seem to work

To enter an exponent
- enter an expression (can be just a number or letter)
- press ^ key
- enter exponent expression (can be just a number)
- press right arrow to return to previous level

To edit an expression:
- use the left and right arrows to position the cursor
  and hold down to repeat
- press del to delete the character under the cursor
- there seems to be no backspace key
- press any number, letter, or operator key
  to replace the character under the cursor
- press 2nd ins to switch to insert mode instead of replace mode
  and press any arrow key to return to replace mode

To store a number in a variable,
enter the number, press sto->,
enter a variable letter, and press enter.

To convert a decimal number to a fraction:

- enter the decimal number
- press math
- select Frac
- press enter

To recall a previous line from history
so it can be optionally edited and re-executed:
- press up and down arrows
- press enter to copy the expression as the current expression
- optionally edit it
- press enter again to execute it

To delete an expression from history:
- press up and down arrows to locate the expression

press 2nd catalog (0 key) and select CLEAR ENTRIES.

Entering characters

- To enter several letters without needing to press alpha before each,
  press 2nd A-lock.
- To unlock, press alpha.
- There are 27 supported letters, A-Z and theta.
- The X,Y,theta,n key inserts one of these four characters
  depending on the mode:
  - X for Function mode
  - T in Parametric mode
  - theta in Polar mode
  - n in Seq mode

Entering fractions

- Press alpha link to display a fraction
  with placeholders for numerator and denominator.
  Alternately, press alpha f1 and select n/d or U n/d.
- Enter a numerator expression.
- Press left or down arrow.
- Enter a denominator expression.

To move the cursor the beginning of the expression, press 2nd left arrow.
To move the cursor the end of the expression, press 2nd right arrow.
To clear the current expression, press clear.
To clear all expressions, press clear a second time.
The previous expressions are still present, just not visible.
Press up arrow to revisit them.

To graph equations:

- press y= to enter them;
  optionally specify the color and line/fill type of each here
  by pressing left arrow to move to color/line icon
- press graph to graph them
- press window to adjust Xmin, Xmax, Xscl, Ymin, Ymax, Yscl
- press trace
  - press left or right to move the cursor
    for a point on the graph left or righ
  - press up or down to move the cursor to a different equation

To disable an equation from being graphed without deleting it

- press y=
- use the up and down arrows to move to the equation
- use the left and right arrows to move to the =
- press enter to toggle the equation
  off (white background) or on (black background)

To evaluate an equation entered using the y= key
for a specific x value:

- store a value in x,
- open the f4 shortcut menu,
- select the equation name (ex. Y1),
- press enter

To graph all equations simultaneously instead of in sequence,
press mode and select SIMUL.

To determine the value of y for a given value of x in a graph,
press 2nd calc, select value, enter a value for x, and press enter.
No y value will be displayed if there is a discontinuity at the x value.

To find minimum values, maximum values, or y intercepts

- press 2nd calc
- select minimum, maximum, or zero (for y intercepts)
- press left or right to move the cursor just to the left of the expected value
- press enter
- press left or right to move the cursor just to the right of the expected value
- press enter
- press enter again to guess the value using a numerical analysis technique
- repeat for other values

To zoom in or out on a graph

- press zoom
- select a zoom option
  - ZStandard resets to standard zoom
    which is Xmin=Ymin=-10 and Xmax=Ymax=10
- press enter

To create a scatter plot:

- press stat and select Edit...
- enter all the x values in the L1 list
- press the right arrow
- enter all the y values in the L2 list
- press 2nd "stat plot"
- if there are previous plots,
  select PlotsOff and press enter to clear them 
- press 2nd "stat plot"
- select the plot to use: Plot1, Plot2, or Plot3
- if it is currently Off, select On
- select the plot Type: scatter, line, bar, ?, ?, or step

  by pressing 2nd and L1 to L6 (often want L1 and L2)
- select the Mark to use for each point
- select the Color
- press graph
- press zoom and select ZoomStat to
  zoom so all the points are visible
- press trace and use the left and right arrows
  to see the coordinates of each point

To add a line of best fit to a scatter plot:

- press stat
- press right arrow to select CALC
- select LinReg
- Xlist should be L1

- move to "Store RegEQ"
- press vars
- press right arrow to move to Y-VARS
- select Function
- select an available function variable to hold the
  linear regression equation that will be calculated
- select Calculate
- the equation will now be saved in the y= list
- it will also display values for a and b
  in the line equation y=ax+b
- press graph

To create a histogram (a.k.a. bar chart):
- draws a bar for each unique value whose height indicates
  the number of times that value appears in the list
- enter values in a single list just like for a scatter plot
- press 2nd "stat plot"
- select Plot1
- turn it On
- select Type histogram icon
- set Xlist to the list to be plotted
  by pressing 2nd and one of L1 to L6
- press zoom
- select ZoomStat
- press graph
- press window to adjust the x and y scales;
  Xmin is the lowest value;
  Xmax is the highest value;
  Xscl controls the width of each bar
  Ymin is the lowest count of a value (typically zero);
  Ymax is the highest count of a value
- to see the value of each bar,
  press trace and the left and right arrows to move between the bars;
  the value is between min= and max<;
  the frequency is the n= value;
  set Xscl to 1 to make min= be the value

- press 2nd quit to return to the home screen
- to recall a named matrix, press 2nd matrix,
  press up and down arrows to select a matrix,
  and press enter

To enter an unnamed matrix:

  and press right arrow or enter
- if the desired number of columns is not already selected,
  press the up and down arrows to select a number of columns,
  and press enter
- press down arrow repeatedly to move to OK and press enter
- enter an expression in each cell pressing right arrow after each
- to store the unnamed matrix in a named matrix,
  press sto-> 2nd matrix,
