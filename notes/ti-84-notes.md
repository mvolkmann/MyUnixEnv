To return to the home screen from any other screen, press 2nd quit.

To set the date and time, press mode and select SET CLOCK.
The date and time are only displayed here on the mode screen.

To enter an exponent
- enter an expression (can be just a number or letter)
- press ^ key
- enter exponent expression (can be just a number)
- press right arrow to return to previous level

To edit an expression:
- use the left and right arrows to position the cursor
  and hold down to repeat
- press del to delete the character under the cursor
- there seems to be no backspace key
- press any number, letter, or operator key
  to replace the character under the cursor
- press 2nd ins to switch to insert mode instead of replace mode
  and press any arrow key to return to replace mode

To convert a decimal number to a fraction:

- enter the decimal number
- press math
- select Frac
- press enter

To recall a previous line from history
so it can be optionally edited and re-executed:
- press up and down arrows
- press enter to copy the expression as the current expression
- optionally edit it
- press enter again to execute it

To delete an expression from history:
- press up and down arrows to locate the expression
- press clear

To delete all expresssions in history,
press 2nd catalog (0 key) and select CLEAR ENTRIES.

Entering characters

- To enter several letters without needing to press alpha before each,
  press 2nd A-lock.
- To unlock, press alpha.
- There are 27 supported letters, A-Z and theta.
- The X,Y,theta,n key inserts one of these four characters
  depending on the mode:
  - X for Function mode
  - T in Parametric mode
  - theta in Polar mode
  - n in Seq mode

Entering fractions

- Press alpha link to display a fraction
  with placeholders for numerator and denominator.
  Alternately, press alpha f1 and select n/d or U n/d.
- Enter a numerator expression.
- Press left or down arrow.
- Enter a denominator expression.

To move the cursor the beginning of the expression, press 2nd left arrow.
To move the cursor the end of the expression, press 2nd right arrow.
To clear the current expression, press clear.
To clear all expressions, press clear a second time.
The previous expressions are still present, just not visible.
Press up arrow to revisit them.

To graph equations:

- press y= to enter them;
  optionally specify the color and line/fill type of each here
  by pressing left arrow to move to color/line icon
- press graph to graph them
- press window to adjust Xmin, Xmax, Xscl, Ymin, Ymax, Yscl
- press trace
  - press left or right to move the cursor
    for a point on the graph left or righ
  - press up or down to move the cursor to a different equation

To graph all equations simultaneously instead of in sequence,
press mode and select SIMUL.

To determine the value of y for a given value of x in a graph,
press 2nd calc, select value, enter a value for x, and press enter.
No y value will be displayed if there is a discontinuity at the x value.

To find minimum values, maximum values, or y intercepts

- press 2nd calc
- select minimum, maximum, or zero (for y intercepts)
- press left or right to move the cursor just to the left of the expected value
- press enter
- press left or right to move the cursor just to the right of the expected value
- press enter
- press enter again to guess the value using a numerical analysis technique
- repeat for other values

To zoom in or out on a graph

- press zoom
- select a zoom option
  - ZStandard resets to standard zoom
    which is Xmin=Ymin=-10 and Xmax=Ymax=10
- press enter

To enter a named matrix:
- press 2nd matrix
- press right arrow twice to highlight EDIT and press enter
- press up and down arrows to highlight the matrix to edit
  and press enter
- if the desired number of rows is not already selected,
  enter the number of rows and press right arrow or enter
- if the desired number of columns is not already selected,
  enter the number of columns and press enter
- enter an expression in each cell, pressing enter after each
- press 2nd quit to return to the home screen
- to recall a named matrix, press 2nd matrix,
  press up and down arrows to select a matrix,
  and press enter

To enter an unnamed matrix:
- press alpha f3
- if MTRX is not selected, press left and right arrows to select it
- if the desired number of rows is not already selected,
  press the up arrow to move the cursor off of OK,
  press the up and down arrows to select a number of rows,
  and press right arrow or enter
- if the desired number of columns is not already selected,
  press the up and down arrows to select a number of columns,
  and press enter
- press down arrow repeatedly to move to OK and press enter
- enter an expression in each cell pressing right arrow after each
- to store the unnamed matrix in a named matrix,
  press sto-> 2nd matrix,
  press up and down arrows to select a matrix name,
  and press enter

To multiply matrices:
- press 2nd matrix
- press up and down arrows to highlight the matrix to use
- press enter to select it
- repeat the steps above to select another matrix
- press enter to multiply them
