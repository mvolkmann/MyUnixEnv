Scales
- Questions
  * Why do most of the scales start at one instead of zero?
    Is it because the values of log between zero and one are negative?
- C & D: multiplication and division
  * single scale
   - represents numbers from 1 to 10
- CF & DF: "folded"
  * same as C & D, but go from pi to pi+10
  * used to avoid resetting the slide
    - if using C & D require a reset then using CF and DF will not
  * to find the circumference of a circle,
    set D to diameter and read circumference from DF
  * to convert radians to degrees, move 180 on C to pi on D,
    move cursor to radians on DF, and read degrees from CF
  * to convert degrees to radians, move 180 on C to pi on D,
    move cursor to degrees on CF, and read radians from DF
- A & B: squares and square roots
  * double scale - two sets of 1-10
    - first set represents numbers from 1 to 10
    - second set represents numbers from 10 to 100
  * can also be used for multiplication and division like A & B,
    but with less precision
- K: cubes and cube roots
  * triple scale - three sets of 1-10
    - first set represents numbers from 1 to 10
    - second set represents numbers from 10 to 100
    - third set represents numbers from 100 to 1000
- CI: inverted C scale
  * same as C scale, but increases right to left
  * useful for reciprocals
  * useful for changing multiplication to an equivalent division
    so slide doesn't have to be switched end-for-end
    - "switch end-for-end" means to move the cursor to the left or right 1 on C
      and then move the other 1 on C to the cursor
  * can also change a division to an equivalent multiplication,
    but why is that useful?
- CIF: inverted, folded C scale
- S: sines and cosines
- T1 - tangents
- ST: sines and tangents of angles less than 5.73 degrees
- L: logarithms (base 10)
  * the only evenly-spaced scale (linear)

Decimal Places
- must determine expected # of digits to left of decimal place mentally
  and adjust the result
  * for example, 123 * 0.2
  * two decimal places to the left are expected
  * multiple 1.23 and 2 to get 2.46
  * answer is 24.6

Direct Read vs. Slide
- the slide is only used for multiplication and division
  * after sliding, pinch top and bottom to hold in place
- all other operations are performed by
  directly reading from one scale to another

Operations
- reciprocals
  * move cursor to x on C
  * read 1/x from CI
  * ex. find reciprocal of 6
    - move cursor to 6 on C
    - read result from CI (1.67)
- squares
  * move cursor to x on D or C
  * read x^2 on A or B
    - location of decimal point in result is determined
      based on the side of A or B where the result falls
    - see examples in middle of p. 26
  * ex. find 1.25^2
    - move cursor to 1.25 on D
    - read result from A (1.56)
  * ex. find 819^2
    - move cursor to 8.19 on D
    - read result from A (6.71 -> 671000; actual=670761)
- square roots
  * move cursor to x on A or B
    - use left side of A or B if x has an odd number of digits or zeros;
      otherwise use right side of A or B
    - slightly more accurate to use B & C since they are closer to each other
  * read x^(1/2) on D or C
    - see rule for determining location of decimal point in result
      at bottom of p. 25 and examples at top of p. 26
  * ex. find square root of 43
    - move cursor to 4.3 on A
    - read result from D (6.56)
  * ex. find square root of 5268
    - move cursor to 5.27 on A
    - read result from D (7.26 -> 72.6; actual=72.581)
- cubes
  * move cursor to x on D
  * read x^3 on K
  * ex. find 1.25^3
    - move cursor to 1.25 on D
    - read result from K (1.95; actual=1.953)
  * ex. find 819^3
    - move cursor to 8.19 on D
    - read result from A (5.49 -> 549; actual=549.35)
- cube roots
  * move cursor to x on K
  * read x^(1/3) on D
  * ex. find cube root of 43
    - move cursor to first 4.3 on K
    - read result from D (3.52; actual=1.626)
  * ex. find cube root of 5268
    - move cursor to 5.27 on K
    - read result from D (1.74 -> 17.4)
- multiplication
  * move left or right 1 on C to x on D
    - using the right 1 on C is like determining where you'd be to the right
      if another slide rule were placed there
      * ex. 9 + 8 = 17; 9 - (10 - 8) = 7 where the next slide rule length = 10
  * move cursor to y on C
  * read x*y from cursor on D
  * alternative #1 - turning multiplication into equivalent division
    - move cursor to x on D
    - move y on CI to cursor
    - move cursor to whichever end of CI is on the rule
    - read x*y from cursor on D
    - works because a/b = a x 1/b
  * alternative #2
    - use A & B instead of C & D to avoid running off end,
       but result has less accuracy
  * special case: multiplication by pi
    - move cursor to x on C or D
    - read result from cursor on DF
  * four methods to determine decimal point location
    1) common sense - place so result is resonable for the problem
    2) estimation - round numbers in problem; perform calculation with those,
       and place decimal point in real result
       so it is close to the estimated result
    3) characteristics - sum of characteristics + 1 if result >= 10
       from preliminary result location
       - gives the number of places to move decimal point (see example on p. 11)
       - also see similar method in "Slide Rule: How To Use It" by Bishop
    4) "Decimal Keeper" scales on some Pickett models
- division
  * approach 1 (seems best, especially for chained calculations)
    - move left or right 1 on C to top number (dividend) on D
    - move cursor to bottom number (divisor) on CI
    - read quotient from D
  * approach 2
    - move top number (dividend) on C over bottom number (divisor) on D
    - move cursor to left 1 on D
    - read quotient from C
  * approach 3
    - move left or right 1 on C to top number (dividend) on D
    - move cursor to bottom number (divisor) on CI
    - read quotient from cursor on D
  * approach 4
    - move left or right 1 on C to bottom number (divisor) on D
    - move cursor to top number (dividend) on D
    - read quotient from cursor on C
  * approach 5 - seems best!
    - move bottom number on C over top number on D
    - read quotient on D under left or right 1 on C
  * shortcut for dividing many numbers by the same number
    - move bottom number on C to left 1 on D
    - move cursor to to each top number on C
    - read each result from D
- proportion
  * to solve for x in a/b = c/x
    - move cursor to a on D
    - move b on C to cursor
    - move cursor to c on D
    - read x from C under cursor
    - can swap C and D in the steps above
- sines (consider table lookup)
  * for angles >= 5.73 degrees
    - move cursor to angle in degrees on S
      * goes from 5.73 to 90,
        increasing slowly on left an rapidly on right
    - read sin x from C
    - ex. sin 67
      * move cursor to 67 on S
      * read result from C (9.2 -> 0.92)
  * for angles < 5.73 degrees
    - move cursor to angle in degrees on ST
      * some slide rules don't have ST scale
    - read sin x from C
    - ex. sin 3
      * move cursor to 3 on ST
      * read result from C (5.23 -> 0.0523)
- cosines (consider table lookup)
  * mentally calculate 90 - angle
  * determine sine of that angle
    - ex. cos 67
      * 90 - 67 = 23
      * move cursor to 23 on S
      * read result from C (3.91 -> 0.391)
    - ex. cos 3
      * 90 - 3 = 87
      * move cursor to 87 on S?
      * TODO: How can you find cosines of small angles?
      * read result from C ( -> 0.999)
- tangents
  * for angles >= 5.73 degrees
    - move cursor to angle in degrees on T1
    - read tan x from C if x <= 45
    - read tan x from CI if x > 45
  * for angles < 5.73 degrees
    - sine of the angle is nearly the same as its tangent,
      so use that
  * for angles > 45
    - the tangent of an angle greater than 45 is
      the reciprocal of the tangent of 90 minus that angle
    - ex. tan 63
      * 90 - 63 = 27
      * move the hairline to 27 on the T scale
      * tan 27 is under the hairline on the D scale (approx. 5.09)
      * slide the right 1 on the C scale to the hairline to divide 1 by 5.09
      * move the hairline to the left 1 on the D scale
      * read the result from the C scale under the hairline (approx. 1.96)

- cotangent
  * determine tangent of the angle, then determine reciprocal of that
- logarithms (base 10)
  * move cursor to x on D
  * read mantissa of log x from L and add characteristic
  * ex. log 38.7, mantissa is 0.588, characteristic is 1,
    so answer is 1.588
  * characteristic is
    0 for 0 <= x < 10
    1 for 10 <= x < 100
    2 for 100 <= x < 1000
    and so on
- natural logs (base e)
  * some slides rules have Ln (or just L) and or LL scales
    that are used for this
  * move cursor to x on C or D
  * read result from Ln
    - you are expected to know the characteristic (integer part)
  * ex. ln 2
    - move cursor to 2 on C or D
    - read mantissa (decimal part) from Ln (0.693)
- other logs
  * solve with a combination of natural logs?
  * example: 2**3 = 8; log base 2 of 8 = 3 = ln 8 / ln 2
- chained calculations (a.k.a. continuous)
  * a sequences of multiplications and divisions can be performed
  * ex. 2 x 6 x 3
    - move right 1 on C to 6
    - move cursor to 2 on D (intermediate result is 12)
    - move left 1 (or sometimes right 1) on C to the cursor
    - move cursor to 3 on C
    - read result from D (final result is 36)
  * ex. 1.5 x 3.2 x 8
    - move left 1 on C to 1.5
    - move cursor to 3.2 on C (intermediate result is 4.8)
    - move right 1 of C to cursor
    - move cursor to 8 on C
    - read result from D (final result is 38.4)
  * ex. 8 * 3 / 5 * 2
    - move right 1 on C to 8
    - move cursor to 3 on C (intermediate result is 24)
    - move left 1 on C to cursor
    - move cursor to 5 on CI (intermediate result from D is 4.8)
    - move left 1 on C to cursor
    - move cursor to 2 on C
    - read result from D (final result is 9.6)
  * ex. 3 x 6 / 4 * 8
    - move cursor to 3 on D
    - move right 1 on C to cursor
    - move cursor to 6 on C (3 x 6 = 18 on D)
    - move 4 on C to cursor
    - move cursor to right 1 on C (18 / 4 = 4.5 on D)
    - move cursor to 8 on C
    - read result from D (final result is 36)
  * (a x c x e) / (b x d)
    - solve as a / b * c / d x e

Math Behind Slide Rules
- multiplication
  log(a * b) = log a + log b
  so a * b = 10^(log a + log b)
- division
  log(a / b) = log a - log b
  so a / b = 10(log a - log b)
